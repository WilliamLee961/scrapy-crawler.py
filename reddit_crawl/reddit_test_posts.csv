* Minecraft command-block creators who want to run low-level programs without mods.
* Hobbyist compiler writers and learners looking for a compact Python codegen example.
* Contributors interested in parsing, code generation, testing strategies, or command optimization.
* This is an educational/hobby tool for small demos and experiments ‚Äî not a production compiler for large-scale programs.

Comparison (how it differs from alternatives):

* Assembly-focused: unlike high-level language‚ÜíMinecraft tools, it targets an assembly-like input so outputs are low-level and easy to debug in command blocks.
* Python-first and lightweight: prioritizes clarity and contributor-friendliness over performance.
* Command-block oriented: designed to work with vanilla in-game command blocks (does not target datapacks or mods).

How to help:

* Test: run examples, try outputs in a world, and note Minecraft version and exact steps when something fails.

I‚Äôve always struggled to get data scientists and analysts to scale their code in the cloud. Almost every time, they‚Äôd have to hand it over to DevOps, the backlog would grow, and overall throughput would tank.

So I built **Burla**, the simplest cluster compute software that lets even Python beginners run code on massive clusters in the cloud. It‚Äôs one function with two parameters: the function and the inputs. You can bring your own Docker image, set hardware requirements, and run jobs as background tasks so you can fire and forget. Responses are fast, and you can call a million simple functions in just a few seconds.

Burla is built for embarrassingly parallel workloads like preprocessing data, hyperparameter tuning, and batch inference.

# Target Audience

Engineers, data scientists, and analysts who want to scale their code in production or research environments without dealing with infrastructure.

# Comparison

Unlike Ray or Dask, Burla doesn‚Äôt require cluster setup, orchestration, or YAML configs. It‚Äôs just:

    from burla import remote_parallel_map
    remote_parallel_map(func, inputs)
    

That‚Äôs it. It automatically handles distribution, retries, logging, and scaling across up to 10,000 VMs.

# Open Source & Free Credits

Burla is open source, and I‚Äôm improving the installation process. I also created managed versions for testing. If you want to try it, I‚Äôll cover 1,000 CPU hours and 100 GPU hours. Email me at [joe@burla.dev]() if interested.

Hey everyone!

Like many of you, I often need to quickly visualize an idea ‚Äì sketch out a project structure, a mind map, or just explain a concept. Every time, I had to open heavy editors like Miro or Figma, which felt like overkill.

So, I decided to build a tool that lives right inside the app I use for communication all day: Telegram.

I'm excited to share my side project: **Diagrammer Bot**. It's a simple yet powerful bot in Python that lets you create diagrams on the fly.

**Here are the key features:**
*   **Text & Image Nodes:** You can create blocks not just from text, but from any image you send.
*   **Full Editing:** Create, connect, edit, and delete both nodes and edges.
*   **Project System:** Save your diagrams with custom names, load them later, or start new ones.
*   **Themes & Export:** Switch between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode. Export your final diagram as a high-quality PNG.
*   **Open-Source:** The entire project is available on GitHub!

**Tech Stack:** Python, `python-telegram-bot`, `Graphviz` for rendering, and `Pillow` for watermarking.

I would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, feature ideas, or bug reports. And of course, a star ‚≠ê on GitHub would make my day!

 I'm a final year CS student and I've been reading about data storage and storage engines. This is a passion project that I've been working on for the past few months. It is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage engine in Python, built from scratch to understand and implement the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture. The project, which is fully open-source, is explicitly optimized for write-heavy workloads. 



# Core Architecture:

The engine implements the three fundamental LSM components: the **Write Ahead Log (WAL)** for durability, an in-memory **Memtable** (using `SortedDict` for sorted writes), and immutable persistent **SSTables (Sorted String Tables)**.

Some features that I'm proud of:

* **Async Compaction**: Merging and compaction are handled by a **separate background worker thread**. The process itself takes a hybrid approach.
* **Client/Server Model**: The entire storage engine runs behind a **FastAPI server**. This allows multiple clients to connect via REST APIs or the included CLI tool.
* **Efficient Range Queries**: Added full support for range queries from `start_key` to `end_key`. This is achieved via a memory-efficient **k-way merge iterator** that combines results from the Memtable and all SSTables. The FastAPI server delivers the results using a `StreamingResponse` to prevent memory exhaustion for large result sets.
* **Bloom Filter**: Implemented a **Bloom Filter** for each SSTable to drastically reduce disk I/O by confirming that a key definitely does not exist before attempting a disk seek.
* **Binary Storage**: SSTables now use **Msgpack binary format** instead of JSON for smaller file sizes and reduced CPU load during serialization/deserialization.

My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.

# Get Started

    pip install lsm_storage_engine_key_value_store

**Usage via CLI/Server:**

1. **Terminal 1 (Server):** `lsm-server`
2. **Terminal 2 (Client):** `lsm-cli` (Follow the CLI help for commands).

# Looking for Feedback

I'd love to hear your thoughts about this implementation and how I can make it better and what features I can add in later versions. Ideas and constructive criticism are always welcome. I'm also looking for contributors, if anyone is interested, please feel free to PM and we can discuss.

```python
from func_to_web import run

def divide(a: int, b: int):
    return a / b

run(divide)  # Web form at localhost:8000
```

**Major updates since v0.1:**

**Dynamic Lists** ‚Äì Add/remove items with advanced validation:
```python
def process_data(
    # Dynamic lists with add/remove buttons
    images: list[ImageFile],                      # Multiple file uploads

    scores: Annotated[
        list[Annotated[int, Field(ge=0, le=100)]], 
        Field(min_length=3, max_length=10)
    ],  # 3-10 items required, each 0-100
    
    # Optional fields with toggle switches
    notes: str | None = None,                     # Optional text
    tags: list[str] | None = None                 # Optional list
):
    return FileResponse(generate_pdf(), ""report.pdf"")  # Auto-download
```

**High-Performance File Handling** ‚Äì Optimized streaming for large files:
- **Upload**: Real-time progress bars, 8MB chunks, handles GB+ files
- **Download**: Return `FileResponse(data, filename)` for auto-downloads
- **Performance**: ~237 MB/s localhost, ~115 MB/s over Gigabit Ethernet
- **Memory efficient**: Constant usage regardless of file size
- **Any format**: PDF, Excel, ZIP, images, binary data

**Optional Fields** ‚Äì `Type | None` creates toggle switches:
- Fields with defaults start enabled, without defaults start disabled
- Explicit control: `Type | OptionalEnabled/OptionalDisabled`
- Works with all types, constraints, and lists

**Dynamic Dropdowns** ‚Äì Runtime-generated options:
```python
def get_themes(): return fetch_from_database()

def configure(theme: Literal[get_themes]): pass  # Fresh options each request
```

**Rich Output Support**:
- **PIL Images**: Auto-displayed in browser
- **Matplotlib plots**: Rendered as PNG
- **File downloads**: Single or multiple files with streaming
- **JSON/text**: Formatted with copy-to-clipboard

**UX Improvements**:
- Dark mode with theme persistence
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Enter to submit)
- Auto-focus first field
- Toast notifications
- Upload progress with speed indicators

**Current stats:**
- 180+ GitHub stars (The chinese community is sharing it too!)
- 454 unit tests
- Published on PyPI: `pip install func-to-web`
- 20+ runnable examples
- Used daily for internal tools at multiple companies

**Other improvements:**
- **Modular architecture**: Code separated by responsibilities (analysis, validation, form building...)
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Every function and class documented
- **Detailed changelog**: Track all improvements and breaking changes

I've tried to make this as professional and production-ready as possible while keeping the simple API.

I‚Äôve always struggled to get data scientists and analysts to scale their code in the cloud. Almost every time, they‚Äôd have to hand it over to DevOps, the backlog would grow, and overall throughput would tank.

So I built **Burla**, the simplest cluster compute software that lets even Python beginners run code on massive clusters in the cloud. It‚Äôs one function with two parameters: the function and the inputs. You can bring your own Docker image, set hardware requirements, and run jobs as background tasks so you can fire and forget. Responses are fast, and you can call a million simple functions in just a few seconds.

Burla is built for embarrassingly parallel workloads like preprocessing data, hyperparameter tuning, and batch inference.

# Target Audience

Engineers, data scientists, and analysts who want to scale their code in production or research environments without dealing with infrastructure.

# Comparison

Unlike Ray or Dask, Burla doesn‚Äôt require cluster setup, orchestration, or YAML configs. It‚Äôs just:

    from burla import remote_parallel_map
    remote_parallel_map(func, inputs)
    

That‚Äôs it. It automatically handles distribution, retries, logging, and scaling across up to 10,000 VMs.

# Open Source & Free Credits

Burla is open source, and I‚Äôm improving the installation process. I also created managed versions for testing. If you want to try it, I‚Äôll cover 1,000 CPU hours and 100 GPU hours. Email me at [joe@burla.dev]() if interested.

Hey everyone!

Like many of you, I often need to quickly visualize an idea ‚Äì sketch out a project structure, a mind map, or just explain a concept. Every time, I had to open heavy editors like Miro or Figma, which felt like overkill.

So, I decided to build a tool that lives right inside the app I use for communication all day: Telegram.

I'm excited to share my side project: **Diagrammer Bot**. It's a simple yet powerful bot in Python that lets you create diagrams on the fly.

**Here are the key features:**
*   **Text & Image Nodes:** You can create blocks not just from text, but from any image you send.
*   **Full Editing:** Create, connect, edit, and delete both nodes and edges.
*   **Project System:** Save your diagrams with custom names, load them later, or start new ones.
*   **Themes & Export:** Switch between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode. Export your final diagram as a high-quality PNG.
*   **Open-Source:** The entire project is available on GitHub!

**Tech Stack:** Python, `python-telegram-bot`, `Graphviz` for rendering, and `Pillow` for watermarking.

I would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, feature ideas, or bug reports. And of course, a star ‚≠ê on GitHub would make my day!

 I'm a final year CS student and I've been reading about data storage and storage engines. This is a passion project that I've been working on for the past few months. It is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage engine in Python, built from scratch to understand and implement the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture. The project, which is fully open-source, is explicitly optimized for write-heavy workloads. 



# Core Architecture:

The engine implements the three fundamental LSM components: the **Write Ahead Log (WAL)** for durability, an in-memory **Memtable** (using `SortedDict` for sorted writes), and immutable persistent **SSTables (Sorted String Tables)**.

Some features that I'm proud of:

* **Async Compaction**: Merging and compaction are handled by a **separate background worker thread**. The process itself takes a hybrid approach.
* **Client/Server Model**: The entire storage engine runs behind a **FastAPI server**. This allows multiple clients to connect via REST APIs or the included CLI tool.
* **Efficient Range Queries**: Added full support for range queries from `start_key` to `end_key`. This is achieved via a memory-efficient **k-way merge iterator** that combines results from the Memtable and all SSTables. The FastAPI server delivers the results using a `StreamingResponse` to prevent memory exhaustion for large result sets.
* **Bloom Filter**: Implemented a **Bloom Filter** for each SSTable to drastically reduce disk I/O by confirming that a key definitely does not exist before attempting a disk seek.
* **Binary Storage**: SSTables now use **Msgpack binary format** instead of JSON for smaller file sizes and reduced CPU load during serialization/deserialization.

My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.

# Get Started

    pip install lsm_storage_engine_key_value_store

**Usage via CLI/Server:**

1. **Terminal 1 (Server):** `lsm-server`
2. **Terminal 2 (Client):** `lsm-cli` (Follow the CLI help for commands).

# Looking for Feedback

I'd love to hear your thoughts about this implementation and how I can make it better and what features I can add in later versions. Ideas and constructive criticism are always welcome. I'm also looking for contributors, if anyone is interested, please feel free to PM and we can discuss.

I‚Äôve always struggled to get data scientists and analysts to scale their code in the cloud. Almost every time, they‚Äôd have to hand it over to DevOps, the backlog would grow, and overall throughput would tank.

So I built **Burla**, the simplest cluster compute software that lets even Python beginners run code on massive clusters in the cloud. It‚Äôs one function with two parameters: the function and the inputs. You can bring your own Docker image, set hardware requirements, and run jobs as background tasks so you can fire and forget. Responses are fast, and you can call a million simple functions in just a few seconds.

Burla is built for embarrassingly parallel workloads like preprocessing data, hyperparameter tuning, and batch inference.

# Target Audience

Engineers, data scientists, and analysts who want to scale their code in production or research environments without dealing with infrastructure.

# Comparison

Unlike Ray or Dask, Burla doesn‚Äôt require cluster setup, orchestration, or YAML configs. It‚Äôs just:

    from burla import remote_parallel_map
    remote_parallel_map(func, inputs)
    

That‚Äôs it. It automatically handles distribution, retries, logging, and scaling across up to 10,000 VMs.

# Open Source & Free Credits

Burla is open source, and I‚Äôm improving the installation process. I also created managed versions for testing. If you want to try it, I‚Äôll cover 1,000 CPU hours and 100 GPU hours. Email me at [joe@burla.dev]() if interested.

Hey everyone!

Like many of you, I often need to quickly visualize an idea ‚Äì sketch out a project structure, a mind map, or just explain a concept. Every time, I had to open heavy editors like Miro or Figma, which felt like overkill.

So, I decided to build a tool that lives right inside the app I use for communication all day: Telegram.

I'm excited to share my side project: **Diagrammer Bot**. It's a simple yet powerful bot in Python that lets you create diagrams on the fly.

**Here are the key features:**
*   **Text & Image Nodes:** You can create blocks not just from text, but from any image you send.
*   **Full Editing:** Create, connect, edit, and delete both nodes and edges.
*   **Project System:** Save your diagrams with custom names, load them later, or start new ones.
*   **Themes & Export:** Switch between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode. Export your final diagram as a high-quality PNG.
*   **Open-Source:** The entire project is available on GitHub!

**Tech Stack:** Python, `python-telegram-bot`, `Graphviz` for rendering, and `Pillow` for watermarking.

I would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, feature ideas, or bug reports. And of course, a star ‚≠ê on GitHub would make my day!

 I'm a final year CS student and I've been reading about data storage and storage engines. This is a passion project that I've been working on for the past few months. It is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage engine in Python, built from scratch to understand and implement the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture. The project, which is fully open-source, is explicitly optimized for write-heavy workloads. 



# Core Architecture:

The engine implements the three fundamental LSM components: the **Write Ahead Log (WAL)** for durability, an in-memory **Memtable** (using `SortedDict` for sorted writes), and immutable persistent **SSTables (Sorted String Tables)**.

Some features that I'm proud of:

* **Async Compaction**: Merging and compaction are handled by a **separate background worker thread**. The process itself takes a hybrid approach.
* **Client/Server Model**: The entire storage engine runs behind a **FastAPI server**. This allows multiple clients to connect via REST APIs or the included CLI tool.
* **Efficient Range Queries**: Added full support for range queries from `start_key` to `end_key`. This is achieved via a memory-efficient **k-way merge iterator** that combines results from the Memtable and all SSTables. The FastAPI server delivers the results using a `StreamingResponse` to prevent memory exhaustion for large result sets.
* **Bloom Filter**: Implemented a **Bloom Filter** for each SSTable to drastically reduce disk I/O by confirming that a key definitely does not exist before attempting a disk seek.
* **Binary Storage**: SSTables now use **Msgpack binary format** instead of JSON for smaller file sizes and reduced CPU load during serialization/deserialization.

My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.

# Get Started

    pip install lsm_storage_engine_key_value_store

**Usage via CLI/Server:**

1. **Terminal 1 (Server):** `lsm-server`
2. **Terminal 2 (Client):** `lsm-cli` (Follow the CLI help for commands).

# Looking for Feedback

I'd love to hear your thoughts about this implementation and how I can make it better and what features I can add in later versions. Ideas and constructive criticism are always welcome. I'm also looking for contributors, if anyone is interested, please feel free to PM and we can discuss.

def divide(a: int, b: int):
    return a / b

run(divide)  # Web form at localhost:8000
```

**Major updates since v0.1:**

```python
def process_data(
    # Dynamic lists with add/remove buttons
    images: list[ImageFile],                      # Multiple file uploads
    
    # Dual validation: list size AND individual items
    scores: Annotated[
        list[Annotated[int, Field(ge=0, le=100)]], 
        Field(min_length=3, max_length=10)
    ],  # 3-10 items required, each 0-100
    
    # Optional fields with toggle switches
    notes: str | None = None,                     # Optional text
    tags: list[str] | None = None                 # Optional list
):
    return FileResponse(generate_pdf(), ""report.pdf"")  # Auto-download
```

**High-Performance File Handling** ‚Äì Optimized streaming for large files:
- **Upload**: Real-time progress bars, 8MB chunks, handles GB+ files
- **Download**: Return `FileResponse(data, filename)` for auto-downloads
- **Performance**: ~237 MB/s localhost, ~115 MB/s over Gigabit Ethernet
- **Memory efficient**: Constant usage regardless of file size
- **Any format**: PDF, Excel, ZIP, images, binary data

**Optional Fields** ‚Äì `Type | None` creates toggle switches:
- Fields with defaults start enabled, without defaults start disabled
- Explicit control: `Type | OptionalEnabled/OptionalDisabled`
- Works with all types, constraints, and lists

**Dynamic Dropdowns** ‚Äì Runtime-generated options:
```python
def get_themes(): return fetch_from_database()

def configure(theme: Literal[get_themes]): pass  # Fresh options each request
```

**Rich Output Support**:
- **PIL Images**: Auto-displayed in browser
- **Matplotlib plots**: Rendered as PNG
- **File downloads**: Single or multiple files with streaming
- **JSON/text**: Formatted with copy-to-clipboard

**UX Improvements**:
- Dark mode with theme persistence
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Enter to submit)
- Auto-focus first field
- Toast notifications
- Upload progress with speed indicators

**Current stats:**
- 180+ GitHub stars (The chinese community is sharing it too!)
- 454 unit tests
- Published on PyPI: `pip install func-to-web`
- 20+ runnable examples
- Used daily for internal tools at multiple companies

**Other improvements:**
- **Modular architecture**: Code separated by responsibilities (analysis, validation, form building...)
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Every function and class documented
- **Detailed changelog**: Track all improvements and breaking changes

I've tried to make this as professional and production-ready as possible while keeping the simple API.

Still focused on internal tools and rapid prototyping, not replacing proper web frameworks.

I‚Äôve always struggled to get data scientists and analysts to scale their code in the cloud. Almost every time, they‚Äôd have to hand it over to DevOps, the backlog would grow, and overall throughput would tank.

So I built **Burla**, the simplest cluster compute software that lets even Python beginners run code on massive clusters in the cloud. It‚Äôs one function with two parameters: the function and the inputs. You can bring your own Docker image, set hardware requirements, and run jobs as background tasks so you can fire and forget. Responses are fast, and you can call a million simple functions in just a few seconds.

Burla is built for embarrassingly parallel workloads like preprocessing data, hyperparameter tuning, and batch inference.

# Target Audience

Engineers, data scientists, and analysts who want to scale their code in production or research environments without dealing with infrastructure.

# Comparison

Unlike Ray or Dask, Burla doesn‚Äôt require cluster setup, orchestration, or YAML configs. It‚Äôs just:

    from burla import remote_parallel_map
    remote_parallel_map(func, inputs)
    

That‚Äôs it. It automatically handles distribution, retries, logging, and scaling across up to 10,000 VMs.

# Open Source & Free Credits

Burla is open source, and I‚Äôm improving the installation process. I also created managed versions for testing. If you want to try it, I‚Äôll cover 1,000 CPU hours and 100 GPU hours. Email me at [joe@burla.dev]() if interested.

Hey everyone!

Like many of you, I often need to quickly visualize an idea ‚Äì sketch out a project structure, a mind map, or just explain a concept. Every time, I had to open heavy editors like Miro or Figma, which felt like overkill.

So, I decided to build a tool that lives right inside the app I use for communication all day: Telegram.

I'm excited to share my side project: **Diagrammer Bot**. It's a simple yet powerful bot in Python that lets you create diagrams on the fly.

**Here are the key features:**
*   **Text & Image Nodes:** You can create blocks not just from text, but from any image you send.
*   **Full Editing:** Create, connect, edit, and delete both nodes and edges.
*   **Project System:** Save your diagrams with custom names, load them later, or start new ones.
*   **Themes & Export:** Switch between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode. Export your final diagram as a high-quality PNG.
*   **Open-Source:** The entire project is available on GitHub!

**Tech Stack:** Python, `python-telegram-bot`, `Graphviz` for rendering, and `Pillow` for watermarking.

I would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, feature ideas, or bug reports. And of course, a star ‚≠ê on GitHub would make my day!

 I'm a final year CS student and I've been reading about data storage and storage engines. This is a passion project that I've been working on for the past few months. It is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage engine in Python, built from scratch to understand and implement the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture. The project, which is fully open-source, is explicitly optimized for write-heavy workloads. 



# Core Architecture:

The engine implements the three fundamental LSM components: the **Write Ahead Log (WAL)** for durability, an in-memory **Memtable** (using `SortedDict` for sorted writes), and immutable persistent **SSTables (Sorted String Tables)**.

Some features that I'm proud of:

* **Async Compaction**: Merging and compaction are handled by a **separate background worker thread**. The process itself takes a hybrid approach.
* **Client/Server Model**: The entire storage engine runs behind a **FastAPI server**. This allows multiple clients to connect via REST APIs or the included CLI tool.
* **Efficient Range Queries**: Added full support for range queries from `start_key` to `end_key`. This is achieved via a memory-efficient **k-way merge iterator** that combines results from the Memtable and all SSTables. The FastAPI server delivers the results using a `StreamingResponse` to prevent memory exhaustion for large result sets.
* **Bloom Filter**: Implemented a **Bloom Filter** for each SSTable to drastically reduce disk I/O by confirming that a key definitely does not exist before attempting a disk seek.
* **Binary Storage**: SSTables now use **Msgpack binary format** instead of JSON for smaller file sizes and reduced CPU load during serialization/deserialization.

My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.

# Get Started

    pip install lsm_storage_engine_key_value_store

**Usage via CLI/Server:**

1. **Terminal 1 (Server):** `lsm-server`
2. **Terminal 2 (Client):** `lsm-cli` (Follow the CLI help for commands).

# Looking for Feedback

I'd love to hear your thoughts about this implementation and how I can make it better and what features I can add in later versions. Ideas and constructive criticism are always welcome. I'm also looking for contributors, if anyone is interested, please feel free to PM and we can discuss.

Since then, I've been working hard on the suggestions and added some major features.

**What it does (quick reminder):**
Turn any Python function into a web UI with zero boilerplate:

```python
from func_to_web import run

def divide(a: int, b: int):
    return a / b

run(divide)  # Web form at localhost:8000
```

**Major updates since v0.1:**

**Dynamic Lists** ‚Äì Add/remove items with advanced validation:
```python
def process_data(
    # Dynamic lists with add/remove buttons
    images: list[ImageFile],                      # Multiple file uploads
    
    # Dual validation: list size AND individual items
    scores: Annotated[
        list[Annotated[int, Field(ge=0, le=100)]], 
        Field(min_length=3, max_length=10)
    ],  # 3-10 items required, each 0-100
    
    # Optional fields with toggle switches
    notes: str | None = None,                     # Optional text
    tags: list[str] | None = None                 # Optional list
):
    return FileResponse(generate_pdf(), ""report.pdf"")  # Auto-download
```

**High-Performance File Handling** ‚Äì Optimized streaming for large files:
- **Upload**: Real-time progress bars, 8MB chunks, handles GB+ files
- **Download**: Return `FileResponse(data, filename)` for auto-downloads
- **Performance**: ~237 MB/s localhost, ~115 MB/s over Gigabit Ethernet
- **Memory efficient**: Constant usage regardless of file size
- **Any format**: PDF, Excel, ZIP, images, binary data

**Optional Fields** ‚Äì `Type | None` creates toggle switches:
- Fields with defaults start enabled, without defaults start disabled
- Explicit control: `Type | OptionalEnabled/OptionalDisabled`
- Works with all types, constraints, and lists

**Dynamic Dropdowns** ‚Äì Runtime-generated options:
```python
def get_themes(): return fetch_from_database()

def configure(theme: Literal[get_themes]): pass  # Fresh options each request
```

**Rich Output Support**:
- **PIL Images**: Auto-displayed in browser
- **Matplotlib plots**: Rendered as PNG
- **File downloads**: Single or multiple files with streaming
- **JSON/text**: Formatted with copy-to-clipboard

**UX Improvements**:
- Dark mode with theme persistence
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Enter to submit)
- Auto-focus first field
- Toast notifications
- Upload progress with speed indicators

**Current stats:**
- 180+ GitHub stars (The chinese community is sharing it too!)
- 454 unit tests
- Published on PyPI: `pip install func-to-web`
- 20+ runnable examples
- Used daily for internal tools at multiple companies

**Other improvements:**
- **Modular architecture**: Code separated by responsibilities (analysis, validation, form building...)
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Every function and class documented
- **Detailed changelog**: Track all improvements and breaking changes

I've tried to make this as professional and production-ready as possible while keeping the simple API.

Still focused on internal tools and rapid prototyping, not replacing proper web frameworks.

# Comparison

Unlike Ray or Dask, Burla doesn‚Äôt require cluster setup, orchestration, or YAML configs. It‚Äôs just:

    from burla import remote_parallel_map
    remote_parallel_map(func, inputs)
    

That‚Äôs it. It automatically handles distribution, retries, logging, and scaling across up to 10,000 VMs.

# Open Source & Free Credits

Burla is open source, and I‚Äôm improving the installation process. I also created managed versions for testing. If you want to try it, I‚Äôll cover 1,000 CPU hours and 100 GPU hours. Email me at [joe@burla.dev]() if interested.

Hey everyone!

Like many of you, I often need to quickly visualize an idea ‚Äì sketch out a project structure, a mind map, or just explain a concept. Every time, I had to open heavy editors like Miro or Figma, which felt like overkill.

So, I decided to build a tool that lives right inside the app I use for communication all day: Telegram.

I'm excited to share my side project: **Diagrammer Bot**. It's a simple yet powerful bot in Python that lets you create diagrams on the fly.

**Here are the key features:**
*   **Text & Image Nodes:** You can create blocks not just from text, but from any image you send.
*   **Full Editing:** Create, connect, edit, and delete both nodes and edges.
*   **Project System:** Save your diagrams with custom names, load them later, or start new ones.
*   **Themes & Export:** Switch between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode. Export your final diagram as a high-quality PNG.
*   **Open-Source:** The entire project is available on GitHub!

**Tech Stack:** Python, `python-telegram-bot`, `Graphviz` for rendering, and `Pillow` for watermarking.

I would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, feature ideas, or bug reports. And of course, a star ‚≠ê on GitHub would make my day!

 I'm a final year CS student and I've been reading about data storage and storage engines. This is a passion project that I've been working on for the past few months. It is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage engine in Python, built from scratch to understand and implement the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture. The project, which is fully open-source, is explicitly optimized for write-heavy workloads. 



# Core Architecture:

The engine implements the three fundamental LSM components: the **Write Ahead Log (WAL)** for durability, an in-memory **Memtable** (using `SortedDict` for sorted writes), and immutable persistent **SSTables (Sorted String Tables)**.

Some features that I'm proud of:

* **Async Compaction**: Merging and compaction are handled by a **separate background worker thread**. The process itself takes a hybrid approach.
* **Client/Server Model**: The entire storage engine runs behind a **FastAPI server**. This allows multiple clients to connect via REST APIs or the included CLI tool.
* **Efficient Range Queries**: Added full support for range queries from `start_key` to `end_key`. This is achieved via a memory-efficient **k-way merge iterator** that combines results from the Memtable and all SSTables. The FastAPI server delivers the results using a `StreamingResponse` to prevent memory exhaustion for large result sets.
* **Bloom Filter**: Implemented a **Bloom Filter** for each SSTable to drastically reduce disk I/O by confirming that a key definitely does not exist before attempting a disk seek.
* **Binary Storage**: SSTables now use **Msgpack binary format** instead of JSON for smaller file sizes and reduced CPU load during serialization/deserialization.

My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.

Since then, I've been working hard on the suggestions and added some major features.

**What it does (quick reminder):**
Turn any Python function into a web UI with zero boilerplate:

```python
from func_to_web import run

def divide(a: int, b: int):
    return a / b

run(divide)  # Web form at localhost:8000
```

**Major updates since v0.1:**

**Dynamic Lists** ‚Äì Add/remove items with advanced validation:
```python
def process_data(
    # Dynamic lists with add/remove buttons
    images: list[ImageFile],                      # Multiple file uploads
    
    # Dual validation: list size AND individual items
    scores: Annotated[
        list[Annotated[int, Field(ge=0, le=100)]], 
        Field(min_length=3, max_length=10)
    ],  # 3-10 items required, each 0-100
    
    # Optional fields with toggle switches
    notes: str | None = None,                     # Optional text
    tags: list[str] | None = None                 # Optional list
):
    return FileResponse(generate_pdf(), ""report.pdf"")  # Auto-download
```

**High-Performance File Handling** ‚Äì Optimized streaming for large files:
- **Upload**: Real-time progress bars, 8MB chunks, handles GB+ files
- **Download**: Return `FileResponse(data, filename)` for auto-downloads
- **Performance**: ~237 MB/s localhost, ~115 MB/s over Gigabit Ethernet
- **Memory efficient**: Constant usage regardless of file size
- **Any format**: PDF, Excel, ZIP, images, binary data

**Optional Fields** ‚Äì `Type | None` creates toggle switches:
- Fields with defaults start enabled, without defaults start disabled
- Explicit control: `Type | OptionalEnabled/OptionalDisabled`
- Works with all types, constraints, and lists

**Dynamic Dropdowns** ‚Äì Runtime-generated options:
```python
def get_themes(): return fetch_from_database()

def configure(theme: Literal[get_themes]): pass  # Fresh options each request
```

**Rich Output Support**:
- **PIL Images**: Auto-displayed in browser
- **Matplotlib plots**: Rendered as PNG
- **File downloads**: Single or multiple files with streaming
- **JSON/text**: Formatted with copy-to-clipboard

**UX Improvements**:
- Dark mode with theme persistence
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Enter to submit)
- Auto-focus first field
- Toast notifications
- Upload progress with speed indicators

**Current stats:**
- 180+ GitHub stars (The chinese community is sharing it too!)
- 454 unit tests
- Published on PyPI: `pip install func-to-web`
- 20+ runnable examples
- Used daily for internal tools at multiple companies

**Other improvements:**
- **Modular architecture**: Code separated by responsibilities (analysis, validation, form building...)
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Every function and class documented
- **Detailed changelog**: Track all improvements and breaking changes

I've tried to make this as professional and production-ready as possible while keeping the simple API.

Still focused on internal tools and rapid prototyping, not replacing proper web frameworks.

What My Project Does:

* Parses a tiny assembly-style language (labels, arithmetic, branches, simple I/O) and emits Minecraft command sequences tailored for command blocks.
* Produces low-level, inspectable output so you can see how program logic maps to in-game command-block logic.
* Implemented in Python for readability and easy contribution.

Target Audience:

* Minecraft command-block creators who want to run low-level programs without mods.
* Hobbyist compiler writers and learners looking for a compact Python codegen example.
* Contributors interested in parsing, code generation, testing strategies, or command optimization.
* This is an educational/hobby tool for small demos and experiments ‚Äî not a production compiler for large-scale programs.

Comparison (how it differs from alternatives):

* Assembly-focused: unlike high-level language‚ÜíMinecraft tools, it targets an assembly-like input so outputs are low-level and easy to debug in command blocks.
* Python-first and lightweight: prioritizes clarity and contributor-friendliness over performance.
* Command-block oriented: designed to work with vanilla in-game command blocks (does not target datapacks or mods).

How to help:

* Test: run examples, try outputs in a world, and note Minecraft version and exact steps when something fails.
* Report: open issues with minimal reproduction files and steps.
* Contribute: PRs welcome for bug fixes, examples, optimizations, docs, or tests ‚Äî look for good-first-issue.",2025-10-21T08:33:29.395151

I‚Äôve always struggled to get data scientists and analysts to scale their code in the cloud. Almost every time, they‚Äôd have to hand it over to DevOps, the backlog would grow, and overall throughput would tank.

So I built **Burla**, the simplest cluster compute software that lets even Python beginners run code on massive clusters in the cloud. It‚Äôs one function with two parameters: the function and the inputs. You can bring your own Docker image, set hardware requirements, and run jobs as background tasks so you can fire and forget. Responses are fast, and you can call a million simple functions in just a few seconds.

Burla is built for embarrassingly parallel workloads like preprocessing data, hyperparameter tuning, and batch inference.

Target Audience:

* Minecraft command-block creators who want to run low-level programs without mods.
* Hobbyist compiler writers and learners looking for a compact Python codegen example.
* Contributors interested in parsing, code generation, testing strategies, or command optimization.
* This is an educational/hobby tool for small demos and experiments ‚Äî not a production compiler for large-scale programs.

Comparison (how it differs from alternatives):

* Assembly-focused: unlike high-level language‚ÜíMinecraft tools, it targets an assembly-like input so outputs are low-level and easy to debug in command blocks.
* Python-first and lightweight: prioritizes clarity and contributor-friendliness over performance.
* Command-block oriented: designed to work with vanilla in-game command blocks (does not target datapacks or mods).

How to help:

* Test: run examples, try outputs in a world, and note Minecraft version and exact steps when something fails.

I‚Äôve always struggled to get data scientists and analysts to scale their code in the cloud. Almost every time, they‚Äôd have to hand it over to DevOps, the backlog would grow, and overall throughput would tank.

So I built **Burla**, the simplest cluster compute software that lets even Python beginners run code on massive clusters in the cloud. It‚Äôs one function with two parameters: the function and the inputs. You can bring your own Docker image, set hardware requirements, and run jobs as background tasks so you can fire and forget. Responses are fast, and you can call a million simple functions in just a few seconds.

Burla is built for embarrassingly parallel workloads like preprocessing data, hyperparameter tuning, and batch inference.

# Target Audience

Engineers, data scientists, and analysts who want to scale their code in production or research environments without dealing with infrastructure.

# Comparison

Unlike Ray or Dask, Burla doesn‚Äôt require cluster setup, orchestration, or YAML configs. It‚Äôs just:

    from burla import remote_parallel_map
    remote_parallel_map(func, inputs)
    

That‚Äôs it. It automatically handles distribution, retries, logging, and scaling across up to 10,000 VMs.

# Open Source & Free Credits

Burla is open source, and I‚Äôm improving the installation process. I also created managed versions for testing. If you want to try it, I‚Äôll cover 1,000 CPU hours and 100 GPU hours. Email me at [joe@burla.dev]() if interested.

Hey everyone!

Like many of you, I often need to quickly visualize an idea ‚Äì sketch out a project structure, a mind map, or just explain a concept. Every time, I had to open heavy editors like Miro or Figma, which felt like overkill.

So, I decided to build a tool that lives right inside the app I use for communication all day: Telegram.

I'm excited to share my side project: **Diagrammer Bot**. It's a simple yet powerful bot in Python that lets you create diagrams on the fly.

**Here are the key features:**
*   **Text & Image Nodes:** You can create blocks not just from text, but from any image you send.
*   **Full Editing:** Create, connect, edit, and delete both nodes and edges.
*   **Project System:** Save your diagrams with custom names, load them later, or start new ones.
*   **Themes & Export:** Switch between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode. Export your final diagram as a high-quality PNG.
*   **Open-Source:** The entire project is available on GitHub!

**Tech Stack:** Python, `python-telegram-bot`, `Graphviz` for rendering, and `Pillow` for watermarking.

I would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, feature ideas, or bug reports. And of course, a star ‚≠ê on GitHub would make my day!

 I'm a final year CS student and I've been reading about data storage and storage engines. This is a passion project that I've been working on for the past few months. It is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage engine in Python, built from scratch to understand and implement the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture. The project, which is fully open-source, is explicitly optimized for write-heavy workloads. 



# Core Architecture:

The engine implements the three fundamental LSM components: the **Write Ahead Log (WAL)** for durability, an in-memory **Memtable** (using `SortedDict` for sorted writes), and immutable persistent **SSTables (Sorted String Tables)**.

Some features that I'm proud of:

* **Async Compaction**: Merging and compaction are handled by a **separate background worker thread**. The process itself takes a hybrid approach.
* **Client/Server Model**: The entire storage engine runs behind a **FastAPI server**. This allows multiple clients to connect via REST APIs or the included CLI tool.
* **Efficient Range Queries**: Added full support for range queries from `start_key` to `end_key`. This is achieved via a memory-efficient **k-way merge iterator** that combines results from the Memtable and all SSTables. The FastAPI server delivers the results using a `StreamingResponse` to prevent memory exhaustion for large result sets.
* **Bloom Filter**: Implemented a **Bloom Filter** for each SSTable to drastically reduce disk I/O by confirming that a key definitely does not exist before attempting a disk seek.
* **Binary Storage**: SSTables now use **Msgpack binary format** instead of JSON for smaller file sizes and reduced CPU load during serialization/deserialization.

My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.

# Get Started

    pip install lsm_storage_engine_key_value_store

**Usage via CLI/Server:**

1. **Terminal 1 (Server):** `lsm-server`
2. **Terminal 2 (Client):** `lsm-cli` (Follow the CLI help for commands).

# Looking for Feedback

I'd love to hear your thoughts about this implementation and how I can make it better and what features I can add in later versions. Ideas and constructive criticism are always welcome. I'm also looking for contributors, if anyone is interested, please feel free to PM and we can discuss.

I‚Äôve always struggled to get data scientists and analysts to scale their code in the cloud. Almost every time, they‚Äôd have to hand it over to DevOps, the backlog would grow, and overall throughput would tank.

So I built **Burla**, the simplest cluster compute software that lets even Python beginners run code on massive clusters in the cloud. It‚Äôs one function with two parameters: the function and the inputs. You can bring your own Docker image, set hardware requirements, and run jobs as background tasks so you can fire and forget. Responses are fast, and you can call a million simple functions in just a few seconds.

Burla is built for embarrassingly parallel workloads like preprocessing data, hyperparameter tuning, and batch inference.

# Target Audience

Engineers, data scientists, and analysts who want to scale their code in production or research environments without dealing with infrastructure.

# Comparison

Unlike Ray or Dask, Burla doesn‚Äôt require cluster setup, orchestration, or YAML configs. It‚Äôs just:

    from burla import remote_parallel_map
    remote_parallel_map(func, inputs)
    

That‚Äôs it. It automatically handles distribution, retries, logging, and scaling across up to 10,000 VMs.

# Open Source & Free Credits

Burla is open source, and I‚Äôm improving the installation process. I also created managed versions for testing. If you want to try it, I‚Äôll cover 1,000 CPU hours and 100 GPU hours. Email me at [joe@burla.dev]() if interested.

Hey everyone!

Like many of you, I often need to quickly visualize an idea ‚Äì sketch out a project structure, a mind map, or just explain a concept. Every time, I had to open heavy editors like Miro or Figma, which felt like overkill.

So, I decided to build a tool that lives right inside the app I use for communication all day: Telegram.

I'm excited to share my side project: **Diagrammer Bot**. It's a simple yet powerful bot in Python that lets you create diagrams on the fly.

**Here are the key features:**
*   **Text & Image Nodes:** You can create blocks not just from text, but from any image you send.
*   **Full Editing:** Create, connect, edit, and delete both nodes and edges.
*   **Project System:** Save your diagrams with custom names, load them later, or start new ones.
*   **Themes & Export:** Switch between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode. Export your final diagram as a high-quality PNG.
*   **Open-Source:** The entire project is available on GitHub!

**Tech Stack:** Python, `python-telegram-bot`, `Graphviz` for rendering, and `Pillow` for watermarking.

I would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, feature ideas, or bug reports. And of course, a star ‚≠ê on GitHub would make my day!

 I'm a final year CS student and I've been reading about data storage and storage engines. This is a passion project that I've been working on for the past few months. It is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage engine in Python, built from scratch to understand and implement the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture. The project, which is fully open-source, is explicitly optimized for write-heavy workloads. 



# Core Architecture:

The engine implements the three fundamental LSM components: the **Write Ahead Log (WAL)** for durability, an in-memory **Memtable** (using `SortedDict` for sorted writes), and immutable persistent **SSTables (Sorted String Tables)**.

Some features that I'm proud of:

* **Async Compaction**: Merging and compaction are handled by a **separate background worker thread**. The process itself takes a hybrid approach.
* **Client/Server Model**: The entire storage engine runs behind a **FastAPI server**. This allows multiple clients to connect via REST APIs or the included CLI tool.
* **Efficient Range Queries**: Added full support for range queries from `start_key` to `end_key`. This is achieved via a memory-efficient **k-way merge iterator** that combines results from the Memtable and all SSTables. The FastAPI server delivers the results using a `StreamingResponse` to prevent memory exhaustion for large result sets.
* **Bloom Filter**: Implemented a **Bloom Filter** for each SSTable to drastically reduce disk I/O by confirming that a key definitely does not exist before attempting a disk seek.
* **Binary Storage**: SSTables now use **Msgpack binary format** instead of JSON for smaller file sizes and reduced CPU load during serialization/deserialization.

My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.

# Get Started

    pip install lsm_storage_engine_key_value_store

**Usage via CLI/Server:**

1. **Terminal 1 (Server):** `lsm-server`
2. **Terminal 2 (Client):** `lsm-cli` (Follow the CLI help for commands).

# Looking for Feedback

I'd love to hear your thoughts about this implementation and how I can make it better and what features I can add in later versions. Ideas and constructive criticism are always welcome. I'm also looking for contributors, if anyone is interested, please feel free to PM and we can discuss.

Since then, I've been working hard on the suggestions and added some major features.

**What it does (quick reminder):**
Turn any Python function into a web UI with zero boilerplate:

```python
from func_to_web import run

def divide(a: int, b: int):
    return a / b

run(divide)  # Web form at localhost:8000
```

**Major updates since v0.1:**

**Dynamic Lists** ‚Äì Add/remove items with advanced validation:
```python
def process_data(
    # Dynamic lists with add/remove buttons
    images: list[ImageFile],                      # Multiple file uploads
    
    # Dual validation: list size AND individual items
    scores: Annotated[
        list[Annotated[int, Field(ge=0, le=100)]], 
        Field(min_length=3, max_length=10)
    ],  # 3-10 items required, each 0-100
    
    # Optional fields with toggle switches
    notes: str | None = None,                     # Optional text
    tags: list[str] | None = None                 # Optional list
):
    return FileResponse(generate_pdf(), ""report.pdf"")  # Auto-download
```

**High-Performance File Handling** ‚Äì Optimized streaming for large files:
- **Upload**: Real-time progress bars, 8MB chunks, handles GB+ files
- **Download**: Return `FileResponse(data, filename)` for auto-downloads
- **Performance**: ~237 MB/s localhost, ~115 MB/s over Gigabit Ethernet
- **Memory efficient**: Constant usage regardless of file size
- **Any format**: PDF, Excel, ZIP, images, binary data

**Optional Fields** ‚Äì `Type | None` creates toggle switches:
- Fields with defaults start enabled, without defaults start disabled
- Explicit control: `Type | OptionalEnabled/OptionalDisabled`
- Works with all types, constraints, and lists

**Dynamic Dropdowns** ‚Äì Runtime-generated options:
```python
def get_themes(): return fetch_from_database()

def configure(theme: Literal[get_themes]): pass  # Fresh options each request
```

**Rich Output Support**:
- **PIL Images**: Auto-displayed in browser
- **Matplotlib plots**: Rendered as PNG
- **File downloads**: Single or multiple files with streaming
- **JSON/text**: Formatted with copy-to-clipboard

**UX Improvements**:
- Dark mode with theme persistence
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Enter to submit)
- Auto-focus first field
- Toast notifications
- Upload progress with speed indicators

**Current stats:**
- 180+ GitHub stars (The chinese community is sharing it too!)
- 454 unit tests
- Published on PyPI: `pip install func-to-web`
- 20+ runnable examples
- Used daily for internal tools at multiple companies

**Other improvements:**
- **Modular architecture**: Code separated by responsibilities (analysis, validation, form building...)
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Every function and class documented
- **Detailed changelog**: Track all improvements and breaking changes

I've tried to make this as professional and production-ready as possible while keeping the simple API.

Still focused on internal tools and rapid prototyping, not replacing proper web frameworks.

 I'm a final year CS student and I've been reading about data storage and storage engines. This is a passion project that I've been working on for the past few months. It is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage engine in Python, built from scratch to understand and implement the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture. The project, which is fully open-source, is explicitly optimized for write-heavy workloads. 



# Core Architecture:

The engine implements the three fundamental LSM components: the **Write Ahead Log (WAL)** for durability, an in-memory **Memtable** (using `SortedDict` for sorted writes), and immutable persistent **SSTables (Sorted String Tables)**.

Some features that I'm proud of:

* **Async Compaction**: Merging and compaction are handled by a **separate background worker thread**. The process itself takes a hybrid approach.
* **Client/Server Model**: The entire storage engine runs behind a **FastAPI server**. This allows multiple clients to connect via REST APIs or the included CLI tool.
* **Efficient Range Queries**: Added full support for range queries from `start_key` to `end_key`. This is achieved via a memory-efficient **k-way merge iterator** that combines results from the Memtable and all SSTables. The FastAPI server delivers the results using a `StreamingResponse` to prevent memory exhaustion for large result sets.
* **Bloom Filter**: Implemented a **Bloom Filter** for each SSTable to drastically reduce disk I/O by confirming that a key definitely does not exist before attempting a disk seek.
* **Binary Storage**: SSTables now use **Msgpack binary format** instead of JSON for smaller file sizes and reduced CPU load during serialization/deserialization.

My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.

Since then, I've been working hard on the suggestions and added some major features.

**What it does (quick reminder):**
Turn any Python function into a web UI with zero boilerplate:

```python
from func_to_web import run

def divide(a: int, b: int):
    return a / b

run(divide)  # Web form at localhost:8000
```

**Major updates since v0.1:**

**Dynamic Lists** ‚Äì Add/remove items with advanced validation:
```python
def process_data(
    # Dynamic lists with add/remove buttons
    images: list[ImageFile],                      # Multiple file uploads
    
    # Dual validation: list size AND individual items
    scores: Annotated[
        list[Annotated[int, Field(ge=0, le=100)]], 
        Field(min_length=3, max_length=10)
    ],  # 3-10 items required, each 0-100
    
    # Optional fields with toggle switches
    notes: str | None = None,                     # Optional text
    tags: list[str] | None = None                 # Optional list
):
    return FileResponse(generate_pdf(), ""report.pdf"")  # Auto-download
```

**High-Performance File Handling** ‚Äì Optimized streaming for large files:
- **Upload**: Real-time progress bars, 8MB chunks, handles GB+ files
- **Download**: Return `FileResponse(data, filename)` for auto-downloads
- **Performance**: ~237 MB/s localhost, ~115 MB/s over Gigabit Ethernet
- **Memory efficient**: Constant usage regardless of file size
- **Any format**: PDF, Excel, ZIP, images, binary data

**Optional Fields** ‚Äì `Type | None` creates toggle switches:
- Fields with defaults start enabled, without defaults start disabled
- Explicit control: `Type | OptionalEnabled/OptionalDisabled`
- Works with all types, constraints, and lists

**Dynamic Dropdowns** ‚Äì Runtime-generated options:
```python
def get_themes(): return fetch_from_database()

def configure(theme: Literal[get_themes]): pass  # Fresh options each request
```

**Rich Output Support**:
- **PIL Images**: Auto-displayed in browser
- **Matplotlib plots**: Rendered as PNG
- **File downloads**: Single or multiple files with streaming
- **JSON/text**: Formatted with copy-to-clipboard

**UX Improvements**:
- Dark mode with theme persistence
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Enter to submit)
- Auto-focus first field
- Toast notifications
- Upload progress with speed indicators

**Current stats:**
- 180+ GitHub stars (The chinese community is sharing it too!)
- 454 unit tests
- Published on PyPI: `pip install func-to-web`
- 20+ runnable examples
- Used daily for internal tools at multiple companies

**Other improvements:**
- **Modular architecture**: Code separated by responsibilities (analysis, validation, form building...)
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Every function and class documented
- **Detailed changelog**: Track all improvements and breaking changes

I've tried to make this as professional and production-ready as possible while keeping the simple API.

Still focused on internal tools and rapid prototyping, not replacing proper web frameworks.

Target Audience:

* Minecraft command-block creators who want to run low-level programs without mods.
* Hobbyist compiler writers and learners looking for a compact Python codegen example.
* Contributors interested in parsing, code generation, testing strategies, or command optimization.
* This is an educational/hobby tool for small demos and experiments ‚Äî not a production compiler for large-scale programs.

Comparison (how it differs from alternatives):

* Assembly-focused: unlike high-level language‚ÜíMinecraft tools, it targets an assembly-like input so outputs are low-level and easy to debug in command blocks.
* Python-first and lightweight: prioritizes clarity and contributor-friendliness over performance.
* Command-block oriented: designed to work with vanilla in-game command blocks (does not target datapacks or mods).

How to help:

* Test: run examples, try outputs in a world, and note Minecraft version and exact steps when something fails.
* Report: open issues with minimal reproduction files and steps.
* Contribute: PRs welcome for bug fixes, examples, optimizations, docs, or tests ‚Äî look for good-first-issue.",2025-10-21T08:46:46.795038

I‚Äôve always struggled to get data scientists and analysts to scale their code in the cloud. Almost every time, they‚Äôd have to hand it over to DevOps, the backlog would grow, and overall throughput would tank.

So I built **Burla**, the simplest cluster compute software that lets even Python beginners run code on massive clusters in the cloud. It‚Äôs one function with two parameters: the function and the inputs. You can bring your own Docker image, set hardware requirements, and run jobs as background tasks so you can fire and forget. Responses are fast, and you can call a million simple functions in just a few seconds.

Burla is built for embarrassingly parallel workloads like preprocessing data, hyperparameter tuning, and batch inference.

# Target Audience

Engineers, data scientists, and analysts who want to scale their code in production or research environments without dealing with infrastructure.

# Comparison

Unlike Ray or Dask, Burla doesn‚Äôt require cluster setup, orchestration, or YAML configs. It‚Äôs just:

    from burla import remote_parallel_map
    remote_parallel_map(func, inputs)
    

That‚Äôs it. It automatically handles distribution, retries, logging, and scaling across up to 10,000 VMs.

# Open Source & Free Credits

Burla is open source, and I‚Äôm improving the installation process. I also created managed versions for testing. If you want to try it, I‚Äôll cover 1,000 CPU hours and 100 GPU hours. Email me at [joe@burla.dev]() if interested.

Hey everyone!

Like many of you, I often need to quickly visualize an idea ‚Äì sketch out a project structure, a mind map, or just explain a concept. Every time, I had to open heavy editors like Miro or Figma, which felt like overkill.

So, I decided to build a tool that lives right inside the app I use for communication all day: Telegram.

I'm excited to share my side project: **Diagrammer Bot**. It's a simple yet powerful bot in Python that lets you create diagrams on the fly.

**Here are the key features:**
*   **Text & Image Nodes:** You can create blocks not just from text, but from any image you send.
*   **Full Editing:** Create, connect, edit, and delete both nodes and edges.
*   **Project System:** Save your diagrams with custom names, load them later, or start new ones.
*   **Themes & Export:** Switch between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode. Export your final diagram as a high-quality PNG.
*   **Open-Source:** The entire project is available on GitHub!

I‚Äôve always struggled to get data scientists and analysts to scale their code in the cloud. Almost every time, they‚Äôd have to hand it over to DevOps, the backlog would grow, and overall throughput would tank.

So I built **Burla**, the simplest cluster compute software that lets even Python beginners run code on massive clusters in the cloud. It‚Äôs one function with two parameters: the function and the inputs. You can bring your own Docker image, set hardware requirements, and run jobs as background tasks so you can fire and forget. Responses are fast, and you can call a million simple functions in just a few seconds.

Burla is built for embarrassingly parallel workloads like preprocessing data, hyperparameter tuning, and batch inference.

# Target Audience

Engineers, data scientists, and analysts who want to scale their code in production or research environments without dealing with infrastructure.

# Comparison

Unlike Ray or Dask, Burla doesn‚Äôt require cluster setup, orchestration, or YAML configs. It‚Äôs just:

    from burla import remote_parallel_map
    remote_parallel_map(func, inputs)
    

That‚Äôs it. It automatically handles distribution, retries, logging, and scaling across up to 10,000 VMs.

# Open Source & Free Credits

Burla is open source, and I‚Äôm improving the installation process. I also created managed versions for testing. If you want to try it, I‚Äôll cover 1,000 CPU hours and 100 GPU hours. Email me at [joe@burla.dev]() if interested.

Hey everyone!

Like many of you, I often need to quickly visualize an idea ‚Äì sketch out a project structure, a mind map, or just explain a concept. Every time, I had to open heavy editors like Miro or Figma, which felt like overkill.

So, I decided to build a tool that lives right inside the app I use for communication all day: Telegram.

I'm excited to share my side project: **Diagrammer Bot**. It's a simple yet powerful bot in Python that lets you create diagrams on the fly.

**Here are the key features:**
*   **Text & Image Nodes:** You can create blocks not just from text, but from any image you send.
*   **Full Editing:** Create, connect, edit, and delete both nodes and edges.
*   **Project System:** Save your diagrams with custom names, load them later, or start new ones.
*   **Themes & Export:** Switch between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode. Export your final diagram as a high-quality PNG.
*   **Open-Source:** The entire project is available on GitHub!

**Tech Stack:** Python, `python-telegram-bot`, `Graphviz` for rendering, and `Pillow` for watermarking.

I would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, feature ideas, or bug reports. And of course, a star ‚≠ê on GitHub would make my day!

 I'm a final year CS student and I've been reading about data storage and storage engines. This is a passion project that I've been working on for the past few months. It is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage engine in Python, built from scratch to understand and implement the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture. The project, which is fully open-source, is explicitly optimized for write-heavy workloads. 



# Core Architecture:

The engine implements the three fundamental LSM components: the **Write Ahead Log (WAL)** for durability, an in-memory **Memtable** (using `SortedDict` for sorted writes), and immutable persistent **SSTables (Sorted String Tables)**.

Some features that I'm proud of:

* **Async Compaction**: Merging and compaction are handled by a **separate background worker thread**. The process itself takes a hybrid approach.
* **Client/Server Model**: The entire storage engine runs behind a **FastAPI server**. This allows multiple clients to connect via REST APIs or the included CLI tool.
* **Efficient Range Queries**: Added full support for range queries from `start_key` to `end_key`. This is achieved via a memory-efficient **k-way merge iterator** that combines results from the Memtable and all SSTables. The FastAPI server delivers the results using a `StreamingResponse` to prevent memory exhaustion for large result sets.
* **Bloom Filter**: Implemented a **Bloom Filter** for each SSTable to drastically reduce disk I/O by confirming that a key definitely does not exist before attempting a disk seek.
* **Binary Storage**: SSTables now use **Msgpack binary format** instead of JSON for smaller file sizes and reduced CPU load during serialization/deserialization.

My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.

# Get Started

    pip install lsm_storage_engine_key_value_store

**Usage via CLI/Server:**

1. **Terminal 1 (Server):** `lsm-server`
2. **Terminal 2 (Client):** `lsm-cli` (Follow the CLI help for commands).

# Looking for Feedback

I'd love to hear your thoughts about this implementation and how I can make it better and what features I can add in later versions. Ideas and constructive criticism are always welcome. I'm also looking for contributors, if anyone is interested, please feel free to PM and we can discuss.

I‚Äôve always struggled to get data scientists and analysts to scale their code in the cloud. Almost every time, they‚Äôd have to hand it over to DevOps, the backlog would grow, and overall throughput would tank.

So I built **Burla**, the simplest cluster compute software that lets even Python beginners run code on massive clusters in the cloud. It‚Äôs one function with two parameters: the function and the inputs. You can bring your own Docker image, set hardware requirements, and run jobs as background tasks so you can fire and forget. Responses are fast, and you can call a million simple functions in just a few seconds.

Burla is built for embarrassingly parallel workloads like preprocessing data, hyperparameter tuning, and batch inference.

# Target Audience

Engineers, data scientists, and analysts who want to scale their code in production or research environments without dealing with infrastructure.

# Comparison

Unlike Ray or Dask, Burla doesn‚Äôt require cluster setup, orchestration, or YAML configs. It‚Äôs just:

    from burla import remote_parallel_map
    remote_parallel_map(func, inputs)
    

That‚Äôs it. It automatically handles distribution, retries, logging, and scaling across up to 10,000 VMs.

# Open Source & Free Credits

Burla is open source, and I‚Äôm improving the installation process. I also created managed versions for testing. If you want to try it, I‚Äôll cover 1,000 CPU hours and 100 GPU hours. Email me at [joe@burla.dev]() if interested.

Hey everyone!

Like many of you, I often need to quickly visualize an idea ‚Äì sketch out a project structure, a mind map, or just explain a concept. Every time, I had to open heavy editors like Miro or Figma, which felt like overkill.

So, I decided to build a tool that lives right inside the app I use for communication all day: Telegram.

I'm excited to share my side project: **Diagrammer Bot**. It's a simple yet powerful bot in Python that lets you create diagrams on the fly.

**Here are the key features:**
*   **Text & Image Nodes:** You can create blocks not just from text, but from any image you send.
*   **Full Editing:** Create, connect, edit, and delete both nodes and edges.
*   **Project System:** Save your diagrams with custom names, load them later, or start new ones.
*   **Themes & Export:** Switch between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode. Export your final diagram as a high-quality PNG.
*   **Open-Source:** The entire project is available on GitHub!

**Tech Stack:** Python, `python-telegram-bot`, `Graphviz` for rendering, and `Pillow` for watermarking.

I would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, feature ideas, or bug reports. And of course, a star ‚≠ê on GitHub would make my day!

 I'm a final year CS student and I've been reading about data storage and storage engines. This is a passion project that I've been working on for the past few months. It is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage engine in Python, built from scratch to understand and implement the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture. The project, which is fully open-source, is explicitly optimized for write-heavy workloads. 



# Core Architecture:

The engine implements the three fundamental LSM components: the **Write Ahead Log (WAL)** for durability, an in-memory **Memtable** (using `SortedDict` for sorted writes), and immutable persistent **SSTables (Sorted String Tables)**.

Some features that I'm proud of:

* **Async Compaction**: Merging and compaction are handled by a **separate background worker thread**. The process itself takes a hybrid approach.
* **Client/Server Model**: The entire storage engine runs behind a **FastAPI server**. This allows multiple clients to connect via REST APIs or the included CLI tool.
* **Efficient Range Queries**: Added full support for range queries from `start_key` to `end_key`. This is achieved via a memory-efficient **k-way merge iterator** that combines results from the Memtable and all SSTables. The FastAPI server delivers the results using a `StreamingResponse` to prevent memory exhaustion for large result sets.
* **Bloom Filter**: Implemented a **Bloom Filter** for each SSTable to drastically reduce disk I/O by confirming that a key definitely does not exist before attempting a disk seek.
* **Binary Storage**: SSTables now use **Msgpack binary format** instead of JSON for smaller file sizes and reduced CPU load during serialization/deserialization.

My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.

# Get Started

    pip install lsm_storage_engine_key_value_store

**Usage via CLI/Server:**

1. **Terminal 1 (Server):** `lsm-server`
2. **Terminal 2 (Client):** `lsm-cli` (Follow the CLI help for commands).

# Looking for Feedback

I'd love to hear your thoughts about this implementation and how I can make it better and what features I can add in later versions. Ideas and constructive criticism are always welcome. I'm also looking for contributors, if anyone is interested, please feel free to PM and we can discuss.

Since then, I've been working hard on the suggestions and added some major features.

**What it does (quick reminder):**
Turn any Python function into a web UI with zero boilerplate:

```python
from func_to_web import run

def divide(a: int, b: int):
    return a / b

run(divide)  # Web form at localhost:8000
```

**Major updates since v0.1:**

**Dynamic Lists** ‚Äì Add/remove items with advanced validation:
```python
def process_data(
    # Dynamic lists with add/remove buttons
    images: list[ImageFile],                      # Multiple file uploads
    
    # Dual validation: list size AND individual items
    scores: Annotated[
        list[Annotated[int, Field(ge=0, le=100)]], 
        Field(min_length=3, max_length=10)
    ],  # 3-10 items required, each 0-100
    
    # Optional fields with toggle switches
    notes: str | None = None,                     # Optional text
    tags: list[str] | None = None                 # Optional list
):
    return FileResponse(generate_pdf(), ""report.pdf"")  # Auto-download
```

**High-Performance File Handling** ‚Äì Optimized streaming for large files:
- **Upload**: Real-time progress bars, 8MB chunks, handles GB+ files
- **Download**: Return `FileResponse(data, filename)` for auto-downloads
- **Performance**: ~237 MB/s localhost, ~115 MB/s over Gigabit Ethernet
- **Memory efficient**: Constant usage regardless of file size
- **Any format**: PDF, Excel, ZIP, images, binary data

**Optional Fields** ‚Äì `Type | None` creates toggle switches:
- Fields with defaults start enabled, without defaults start disabled
- Explicit control: `Type | OptionalEnabled/OptionalDisabled`
- Works with all types, constraints, and lists

**Dynamic Dropdowns** ‚Äì Runtime-generated options:
```python
def get_themes(): return fetch_from_database()

def configure(theme: Literal[get_themes]): pass  # Fresh options each request
```

**Rich Output Support**:
- **PIL Images**: Auto-displayed in browser
- **Matplotlib plots**: Rendered as PNG
- **File downloads**: Single or multiple files with streaming
- **JSON/text**: Formatted with copy-to-clipboard

**UX Improvements**:
- Dark mode with theme persistence
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Enter to submit)
- Auto-focus first field
- Toast notifications
- Upload progress with speed indicators

**Current stats:**
- 180+ GitHub stars (The chinese community is sharing it too!)
- 454 unit tests
- Published on PyPI: `pip install func-to-web`
- 20+ runnable examples
- Used daily for internal tools at multiple companies

**Other improvements:**
- **Modular architecture**: Code separated by responsibilities (analysis, validation, form building...)
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Every function and class documented
- **Detailed changelog**: Track all improvements and breaking changes

I've tried to make this as professional and production-ready as possible while keeping the simple API.

Still focused on internal tools and rapid prototyping, not replacing proper web frameworks.

Repo:¬†[https://github.com/Bowser04/Assembly-to-Minecraft-Command-Block-Compiler](https://github.com/Bowser04/Assembly-to-Minecraft-Command-Block-Compiler)

What My Project Does:

* Parses a tiny assembly-style language (labels, arithmetic, branches, simple I/O) and emits Minecraft command sequences tailored for command blocks.
* Produces low-level, inspectable output so you can see how program logic maps to in-game command-block logic.
* Implemented in Python for readability and easy contribution.

Target Audience:

* Minecraft command-block creators who want to run low-level programs without mods.
* Hobbyist compiler writers and learners looking for a compact Python codegen example.
* Contributors interested in parsing, code generation, testing strategies, or command optimization.
* This is an educational/hobby tool for small demos and experiments ‚Äî not a production compiler for large-scale programs.

Comparison (how it differs from alternatives):

* Assembly-focused: unlike high-level language‚ÜíMinecraft tools, it targets an assembly-like input so outputs are low-level and easy to debug in command blocks.
* Python-first and lightweight: prioritizes clarity and contributor-friendliness over performance.
* Command-block oriented: designed to work with vanilla in-game command blocks (does not target datapacks or mods).

How to help:

* Test: run examples, try outputs in a world, and note Minecraft version and exact steps when something fails.
* Report: open issues with minimal reproduction files and steps.
* Contribute: PRs welcome for bug fixes, examples, optimizations, docs, or tests ‚Äî look for good-first-issue.",2025-10-21T08:51:17.067599

**High-Performance File Handling** ‚Äì Optimized streaming for large files:
- **Upload**: Real-time progress bars, 8MB chunks, handles GB+ files
- **Download**: Return `FileResponse(data, filename)` for auto-downloads
- **Performance**: ~237 MB/s localhost, ~115 MB/s over Gigabit Ethernet
- **Memory efficient**: Constant usage regardless of file size
- **Any format**: PDF, Excel, ZIP, images, binary data

**Optional Fields** ‚Äì `Type | None` creates toggle switches:

I‚Äôve always struggled to get data scientists and analysts to scale their code in the cloud. Almost every time, they‚Äôd have to hand it over to DevOps, the backlog would grow, and overall throughput would tank.

So I built **Burla**, the simplest cluster compute software that lets even Python beginners run code on massive clusters in the cloud. It‚Äôs one function with two parameters: the function and the inputs. You can bring your own Docker image, set hardware requirements, and run jobs as background tasks so you can fire and forget. Responses are fast, and you can call a million simple functions in just a few seconds.

Burla is built for embarrassingly parallel workloads like preprocessing data, hyperparameter tuning, and batch inference.

# Target Audience

Engineers, data scientists, and analysts who want to scale their code in production or research environments without dealing with infrastructure.

# Comparison

Unlike Ray or Dask, Burla doesn‚Äôt require cluster setup, orchestration, or YAML configs. It‚Äôs just:

    from burla import remote_parallel_map
    remote_parallel_map(func, inputs)
    

That‚Äôs it. It automatically handles distribution, retries, logging, and scaling across up to 10,000 VMs.

# Open Source & Free Credits

Burla is open source, and I‚Äôm improving the installation process. I also created managed versions for testing. If you want to try it, I‚Äôll cover 1,000 CPU hours and 100 GPU hours. Email me at [joe@burla.dev]() if interested.

Hey everyone!

Like many of you, I often need to quickly visualize an idea ‚Äì sketch out a project structure, a mind map, or just explain a concept. Every time, I had to open heavy editors like Miro or Figma, which felt like overkill.

So, I decided to build a tool that lives right inside the app I use for communication all day: Telegram.

I'm excited to share my side project: **Diagrammer Bot**. It's a simple yet powerful bot in Python that lets you create diagrams on the fly.

**Here are the key features:**
*   **Text & Image Nodes:** You can create blocks not just from text, but from any image you send.
*   **Full Editing:** Create, connect, edit, and delete both nodes and edges.
*   **Project System:** Save your diagrams with custom names, load them later, or start new ones.
*   **Themes & Export:** Switch between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode. Export your final diagram as a high-quality PNG.
*   **Open-Source:** The entire project is available on GitHub!

**Tech Stack:** Python, `python-telegram-bot`, `Graphviz` for rendering, and `Pillow` for watermarking.

I would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, feature ideas, or bug reports. And of course, a star ‚≠ê on GitHub would make my day!

 I'm a final year CS student and I've been reading about data storage and storage engines. This is a passion project that I've been working on for the past few months. It is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage engine in Python, built from scratch to understand and implement the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture. The project, which is fully open-source, is explicitly optimized for write-heavy workloads. 



# Core Architecture:

The engine implements the three fundamental LSM components: the **Write Ahead Log (WAL)** for durability, an in-memory **Memtable** (using `SortedDict` for sorted writes), and immutable persistent **SSTables (Sorted String Tables)**.

Some features that I'm proud of:

* **Async Compaction**: Merging and compaction are handled by a **separate background worker thread**. The process itself takes a hybrid approach.
* **Client/Server Model**: The entire storage engine runs behind a **FastAPI server**. This allows multiple clients to connect via REST APIs or the included CLI tool.
* **Efficient Range Queries**: Added full support for range queries from `start_key` to `end_key`. This is achieved via a memory-efficient **k-way merge iterator** that combines results from the Memtable and all SSTables. The FastAPI server delivers the results using a `StreamingResponse` to prevent memory exhaustion for large result sets.
* **Bloom Filter**: Implemented a **Bloom Filter** for each SSTable to drastically reduce disk I/O by confirming that a key definitely does not exist before attempting a disk seek.
* **Binary Storage**: SSTables now use **Msgpack binary format** instead of JSON for smaller file sizes and reduced CPU load during serialization/deserialization.

My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.

I‚Äôve always struggled to get data scientists and analysts to scale their code in the cloud. Almost every time, they‚Äôd have to hand it over to DevOps, the backlog would grow, and overall throughput would tank.

So I built **Burla**, the simplest cluster compute software that lets even Python beginners run code on massive clusters in the cloud. It‚Äôs one function with two parameters: the function and the inputs. You can bring your own Docker image, set hardware requirements, and run jobs as background tasks so you can fire and forget. Responses are fast, and you can call a million simple functions in just a few seconds.

Burla is built for embarrassingly parallel workloads like preprocessing data, hyperparameter tuning, and batch inference.

# Target Audience

Engineers, data scientists, and analysts who want to scale their code in production or research environments without dealing with infrastructure.

# Comparison

Unlike Ray or Dask, Burla doesn‚Äôt require cluster setup, orchestration, or YAML configs. It‚Äôs just:

    from burla import remote_parallel_map
    remote_parallel_map(func, inputs)
    

That‚Äôs it. It automatically handles distribution, retries, logging, and scaling across up to 10,000 VMs.

# Open Source & Free Credits

Burla is open source, and I‚Äôm improving the installation process. I also created managed versions for testing. If you want to try it, I‚Äôll cover 1,000 CPU hours and 100 GPU hours. Email me at [joe@burla.dev]() if interested.

Hey everyone!

Like many of you, I often need to quickly visualize an idea ‚Äì sketch out a project structure, a mind map, or just explain a concept. Every time, I had to open heavy editors like Miro or Figma, which felt like overkill.

So, I decided to build a tool that lives right inside the app I use for communication all day: Telegram.

I'm excited to share my side project: **Diagrammer Bot**. It's a simple yet powerful bot in Python that lets you create diagrams on the fly.

**Here are the key features:**
*   **Text & Image Nodes:** You can create blocks not just from text, but from any image you send.
*   **Full Editing:** Create, connect, edit, and delete both nodes and edges.
*   **Project System:** Save your diagrams with custom names, load them later, or start new ones.
*   **Themes & Export:** Switch between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode. Export your final diagram as a high-quality PNG.
*   **Open-Source:** The entire project is available on GitHub!

**Tech Stack:** Python, `python-telegram-bot`, `Graphviz` for rendering, and `Pillow` for watermarking.

I would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, feature ideas, or bug reports. And of course, a star ‚≠ê on GitHub would make my day!

 I'm a final year CS student and I've been reading about data storage and storage engines. This is a passion project that I've been working on for the past few months. It is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage engine in Python, built from scratch to understand and implement the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture. The project, which is fully open-source, is explicitly optimized for write-heavy workloads. 



# Core Architecture:

The engine implements the three fundamental LSM components: the **Write Ahead Log (WAL)** for durability, an in-memory **Memtable** (using `SortedDict` for sorted writes), and immutable persistent **SSTables (Sorted String Tables)**.

Some features that I'm proud of:

* **Async Compaction**: Merging and compaction are handled by a **separate background worker thread**. The process itself takes a hybrid approach.
* **Client/Server Model**: The entire storage engine runs behind a **FastAPI server**. This allows multiple clients to connect via REST APIs or the included CLI tool.
* **Efficient Range Queries**: Added full support for range queries from `start_key` to `end_key`. This is achieved via a memory-efficient **k-way merge iterator** that combines results from the Memtable and all SSTables. The FastAPI server delivers the results using a `StreamingResponse` to prevent memory exhaustion for large result sets.
* **Bloom Filter**: Implemented a **Bloom Filter** for each SSTable to drastically reduce disk I/O by confirming that a key definitely does not exist before attempting a disk seek.
* **Binary Storage**: SSTables now use **Msgpack binary format** instead of JSON for smaller file sizes and reduced CPU load during serialization/deserialization.

My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.

# Get Started

    pip install lsm_storage_engine_key_value_store

**Usage via CLI/Server:**

1. **Terminal 1 (Server):** `lsm-server`
2. **Terminal 2 (Client):** `lsm-cli` (Follow the CLI help for commands).

# Looking for Feedback

I'd love to hear your thoughts about this implementation and how I can make it better and what features I can add in later versions. Ideas and constructive criticism are always welcome. I'm also looking for contributors, if anyone is interested, please feel free to PM and we can discuss.

Since then, I've been working hard on the suggestions and added some major features.

**What it does (quick reminder):**
Turn any Python function into a web UI with zero boilerplate:

```python
from func_to_web import run

def divide(a: int, b: int):
    return a / b

run(divide)  # Web form at localhost:8000
```

**Major updates since v0.1:**

**Dynamic Lists** ‚Äì Add/remove items with advanced validation:
```python
def process_data(
    # Dynamic lists with add/remove buttons
    images: list[ImageFile],                      # Multiple file uploads
    
    # Dual validation: list size AND individual items
    scores: Annotated[
        list[Annotated[int, Field(ge=0, le=100)]], 
        Field(min_length=3, max_length=10)
    ],  # 3-10 items required, each 0-100
    
    # Optional fields with toggle switches
    notes: str | None = None,                     # Optional text
    tags: list[str] | None = None                 # Optional list
):
    return FileResponse(generate_pdf(), ""report.pdf"")  # Auto-download
```

**High-Performance File Handling** ‚Äì Optimized streaming for large files:
- **Upload**: Real-time progress bars, 8MB chunks, handles GB+ files
- **Download**: Return `FileResponse(data, filename)` for auto-downloads
- **Performance**: ~237 MB/s localhost, ~115 MB/s over Gigabit Ethernet
- **Memory efficient**: Constant usage regardless of file size
- **Any format**: PDF, Excel, ZIP, images, binary data

**Optional Fields** ‚Äì `Type | None` creates toggle switches:
- Fields with defaults start enabled, without defaults start disabled
- Explicit control: `Type | OptionalEnabled/OptionalDisabled`
- Works with all types, constraints, and lists

**Dynamic Dropdowns** ‚Äì Runtime-generated options:
```python
def get_themes(): return fetch_from_database()

def configure(theme: Literal[get_themes]): pass  # Fresh options each request
```

**Rich Output Support**:
- **PIL Images**: Auto-displayed in browser
- **Matplotlib plots**: Rendered as PNG
- **File downloads**: Single or multiple files with streaming
- **JSON/text**: Formatted with copy-to-clipboard

**UX Improvements**:
- Dark mode with theme persistence
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Enter to submit)
- Auto-focus first field
- Toast notifications
- Upload progress with speed indicators

**Current stats:**
- 180+ GitHub stars (The chinese community is sharing it too!)
- 454 unit tests
- Published on PyPI: `pip install func-to-web`
- 20+ runnable examples
- Used daily for internal tools at multiple companies

**Other improvements:**
- **Modular architecture**: Code separated by responsibilities (analysis, validation, form building...)
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Every function and class documented
- **Detailed changelog**: Track all improvements and breaking changes

I've tried to make this as professional and production-ready as possible while keeping the simple API.

Still focused on internal tools and rapid prototyping, not replacing proper web frameworks.

Burla is built for embarrassingly parallel workloads like preprocessing data, hyperparameter tuning, and batch inference.

# Target Audience

Engineers, data scientists, and analysts who want to scale their code in production or research environments without dealing with infrastructure.

# Comparison

Unlike Ray or Dask, Burla doesn‚Äôt require cluster setup, orchestration, or YAML configs. It‚Äôs just:

    from burla import remote_parallel_map
    remote_parallel_map(func, inputs)
    

That‚Äôs it. It automatically handles distribution, retries, logging, and scaling across up to 10,000 VMs.

# Open Source & Free Credits

Burla is open source, and I‚Äôm improving the installation process. I also created managed versions for testing. If you want to try it, I‚Äôll cover 1,000 CPU hours and 100 GPU hours. Email me at [joe@burla.dev]() if interested.

Hey everyone!

Like many of you, I often need to quickly visualize an idea ‚Äì sketch out a project structure, a mind map, or just explain a concept. Every time, I had to open heavy editors like Miro or Figma, which felt like overkill.

So, I decided to build a tool that lives right inside the app I use for communication all day: Telegram.

I'm excited to share my side project: **Diagrammer Bot**. It's a simple yet powerful bot in Python that lets you create diagrams on the fly.

**Here are the key features:**
*   **Text & Image Nodes:** You can create blocks not just from text, but from any image you send.
*   **Full Editing:** Create, connect, edit, and delete both nodes and edges.
*   **Project System:** Save your diagrams with custom names, load them later, or start new ones.
*   **Themes & Export:** Switch between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode. Export your final diagram as a high-quality PNG.
*   **Open-Source:** The entire project is available on GitHub!

**Tech Stack:** Python, `python-telegram-bot`, `Graphviz` for rendering, and `Pillow` for watermarking.

I would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, feature ideas, or bug reports. And of course, a star ‚≠ê on GitHub would make my day!

 I'm a final year CS student and I've been reading about data storage and storage engines. This is a passion project that I've been working on for the past few months. It is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage engine in Python, built from scratch to understand and implement the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture. The project, which is fully open-source, is explicitly optimized for write-heavy workloads. 



# Core Architecture:

The engine implements the three fundamental LSM components: the **Write Ahead Log (WAL)** for durability, an in-memory **Memtable** (using `SortedDict` for sorted writes), and immutable persistent **SSTables (Sorted String Tables)**.

Some features that I'm proud of:

* **Async Compaction**: Merging and compaction are handled by a **separate background worker thread**. The process itself takes a hybrid approach.
* **Client/Server Model**: The entire storage engine runs behind a **FastAPI server**. This allows multiple clients to connect via REST APIs or the included CLI tool.
* **Efficient Range Queries**: Added full support for range queries from `start_key` to `end_key`. This is achieved via a memory-efficient **k-way merge iterator** that combines results from the Memtable and all SSTables. The FastAPI server delivers the results using a `StreamingResponse` to prevent memory exhaustion for large result sets.
* **Bloom Filter**: Implemented a **Bloom Filter** for each SSTable to drastically reduce disk I/O by confirming that a key definitely does not exist before attempting a disk seek.
* **Binary Storage**: SSTables now use **Msgpack binary format** instead of JSON for smaller file sizes and reduced CPU load during serialization/deserialization.

My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.

**Usage via CLI/Server:**

1. **Terminal 1 (Server):** `lsm-server`
2. **Terminal 2 (Client):** `lsm-cli` (Follow the CLI help for commands).

Since then, I've been working hard on the suggestions and added some major features.

**What it does (quick reminder):**
Turn any Python function into a web UI with zero boilerplate:

```python
from func_to_web import run

def divide(a: int, b: int):
    return a / b

run(divide)  # Web form at localhost:8000
```

**Major updates since v0.1:**

**Dynamic Lists** ‚Äì Add/remove items with advanced validation:
```python
def process_data(
    # Dynamic lists with add/remove buttons
    images: list[ImageFile],                      # Multiple file uploads
    
    # Dual validation: list size AND individual items
    scores: Annotated[
        list[Annotated[int, Field(ge=0, le=100)]], 
        Field(min_length=3, max_length=10)
    ],  # 3-10 items required, each 0-100
    
    # Optional fields with toggle switches
    notes: str | None = None,                     # Optional text
    tags: list[str] | None = None                 # Optional list
):
    return FileResponse(generate_pdf(), ""report.pdf"")  # Auto-download
```

**High-Performance File Handling** ‚Äì Optimized streaming for large files:
- **Upload**: Real-time progress bars, 8MB chunks, handles GB+ files
- **Download**: Return `FileResponse(data, filename)` for auto-downloads
- **Performance**: ~237 MB/s localhost, ~115 MB/s over Gigabit Ethernet
- **Memory efficient**: Constant usage regardless of file size
- **Any format**: PDF, Excel, ZIP, images, binary data

**Optional Fields** ‚Äì `Type | None` creates toggle switches:
- Fields with defaults start enabled, without defaults start disabled
- Explicit control: `Type | OptionalEnabled/OptionalDisabled`
- Works with all types, constraints, and lists

**Dynamic Dropdowns** ‚Äì Runtime-generated options:
```python
def get_themes(): return fetch_from_database()

def configure(theme: Literal[get_themes]): pass  # Fresh options each request
```

**Rich Output Support**:
- **PIL Images**: Auto-displayed in browser
- **Matplotlib plots**: Rendered as PNG
- **File downloads**: Single or multiple files with streaming
- **JSON/text**: Formatted with copy-to-clipboard

**UX Improvements**:
- Dark mode with theme persistence
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Enter to submit)
- Auto-focus first field
- Toast notifications
- Upload progress with speed indicators

**Current stats:**
- 180+ GitHub stars (The chinese community is sharing it too!)
- 454 unit tests
- Published on PyPI: `pip install func-to-web`
- 20+ runnable examples
- Used daily for internal tools at multiple companies

**Other improvements:**
- **Modular architecture**: Code separated by responsibilities (analysis, validation, form building...)
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Every function and class documented
- **Detailed changelog**: Track all improvements and breaking changes

I've tried to make this as professional and production-ready as possible while keeping the simple API.

Still focused on internal tools and rapid prototyping, not replacing proper web frameworks.

What My Project Does:

* Parses a tiny assembly-style language (labels, arithmetic, branches, simple I/O) and emits Minecraft command sequences tailored for command blocks.
* Produces low-level, inspectable output so you can see how program logic maps to in-game command-block logic.
* Implemented in Python for readability and easy contribution.

Target Audience:

* Minecraft command-block creators who want to run low-level programs without mods.
* Hobbyist compiler writers and learners looking for a compact Python codegen example.
* Contributors interested in parsing, code generation, testing strategies, or command optimization.
* This is an educational/hobby tool for small demos and experiments ‚Äî not a production compiler for large-scale programs.

Comparison (how it differs from alternatives):

* Assembly-focused: unlike high-level language‚ÜíMinecraft tools, it targets an assembly-like input so outputs are low-level and easy to debug in command blocks.
* Python-first and lightweight: prioritizes clarity and contributor-friendliness over performance.
* Command-block oriented: designed to work with vanilla in-game command blocks (does not target datapacks or mods).

How to help:

* Test: run examples, try outputs in a world, and note Minecraft version and exact steps when something fails.
* Report: open issues with minimal reproduction files and steps.
* Contribute: PRs welcome for bug fixes, examples, optimizations, docs, or tests ‚Äî look for good-first-issue.",2025-10-21T09:02:02.869538

Since then, I've been working hard on the suggestions and added some major features.

**What it does (quick reminder):**
Turn any Python function into a web UI with zero boilerplate:

```python
from func_to_web import run

def divide(a: int, b: int):
    return a / b

run(divide)  # Web form at localhost:8000
```

**Major updates since v0.1:**

**Dynamic Lists** ‚Äì Add/remove items with advanced validation:
```python
def process_data(
    # Dynamic lists with add/remove buttons
    images: list[ImageFile],                      # Multiple file uploads

    tags: list[str] | None = None                 # Optional list
):
    return FileResponse(generate_pdf(), ""report.pdf"")  # Auto-download
```

**High-Performance File Handling** ‚Äì Optimized streaming for large files:
- **Upload**: Real-time progress bars, 8MB chunks, handles GB+ files
- **Download**: Return `FileResponse(data, filename)` for auto-downloads
- **Performance**: ~237 MB/s localhost, ~115 MB/s over Gigabit Ethernet
- **Memory efficient**: Constant usage regardless of file size
- **Any format**: PDF, Excel, ZIP, images, binary data

**Optional Fields** ‚Äì `Type | None` creates toggle switches:
- Fields with defaults start enabled, without defaults start disabled
- Explicit control: `Type | OptionalEnabled/OptionalDisabled`
- Works with all types, constraints, and lists

**Dynamic Dropdowns** ‚Äì Runtime-generated options:
```python
def get_themes(): return fetch_from_database()

def configure(theme: Literal[get_themes]): pass  # Fresh options each request
```

**Rich Output Support**:
- **PIL Images**: Auto-displayed in browser
- **Matplotlib plots**: Rendered as PNG
- **File downloads**: Single or multiple files with streaming
- **JSON/text**: Formatted with copy-to-clipboard

**UX Improvements**:
- Dark mode with theme persistence
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Enter to submit)
- Auto-focus first field
- Toast notifications
- Upload progress with speed indicators

**Current stats:**
- 180+ GitHub stars (The chinese community is sharing it too!)
- 454 unit tests
- Published on PyPI: `pip install func-to-web`
- 20+ runnable examples
- Used daily for internal tools at multiple companies

**Other improvements:**
- **Modular architecture**: Code separated by responsibilities (analysis, validation, form building...)
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Every function and class documented
- **Detailed changelog**: Track all improvements and breaking changes

Target Audience:

* Minecraft command-block creators who want to run low-level programs without mods.
* Hobbyist compiler writers and learners looking for a compact Python codegen example.
* Contributors interested in parsing, code generation, testing strategies, or command optimization.
* This is an educational/hobby tool for small demos and experiments ‚Äî not a production compiler for large-scale programs.

Comparison (how it differs from alternatives):

* Assembly-focused: unlike high-level language‚ÜíMinecraft tools, it targets an assembly-like input so outputs are low-level and easy to debug in command blocks.
* Python-first and lightweight: prioritizes clarity and contributor-friendliness over performance.
* Command-block oriented: designed to work with vanilla in-game command blocks (does not target datapacks or mods).

How to help:

I‚Äôve always struggled to get data scientists and analysts to scale their code in the cloud. Almost every time, they‚Äôd have to hand it over to DevOps, the backlog would grow, and overall throughput would tank.

So I built **Burla**, the simplest cluster compute software that lets even Python beginners run code on massive clusters in the cloud. It‚Äôs one function with two parameters: the function and the inputs. You can bring your own Docker image, set hardware requirements, and run jobs as background tasks so you can fire and forget. Responses are fast, and you can call a million simple functions in just a few seconds.

Burla is built for embarrassingly parallel workloads like preprocessing data, hyperparameter tuning, and batch inference.

# Target Audience

Engineers, data scientists, and analysts who want to scale their code in production or research environments without dealing with infrastructure.

# Comparison

Unlike Ray or Dask, Burla doesn‚Äôt require cluster setup, orchestration, or YAML configs. It‚Äôs just:

    from burla import remote_parallel_map
    remote_parallel_map(func, inputs)
    

That‚Äôs it. It automatically handles distribution, retries, logging, and scaling across up to 10,000 VMs.

# Open Source & Free Credits

Burla is open source, and I‚Äôm improving the installation process. I also created managed versions for testing. If you want to try it, I‚Äôll cover 1,000 CPU hours and 100 GPU hours. Email me at [joe@burla.dev]() if interested.

Hey everyone!

Like many of you, I often need to quickly visualize an idea ‚Äì sketch out a project structure, a mind map, or just explain a concept. Every time, I had to open heavy editors like Miro or Figma, which felt like overkill.

So, I decided to build a tool that lives right inside the app I use for communication all day: Telegram.

I'm excited to share my side project: **Diagrammer Bot**. It's a simple yet powerful bot in Python that lets you create diagrams on the fly.

**Here are the key features:**
*   **Text & Image Nodes:** You can create blocks not just from text, but from any image you send.
*   **Full Editing:** Create, connect, edit, and delete both nodes and edges.
*   **Project System:** Save your diagrams with custom names, load them later, or start new ones.
*   **Themes & Export:** Switch between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode. Export your final diagram as a high-quality PNG.
*   **Open-Source:** The entire project is available on GitHub!

**Tech Stack:** Python, `python-telegram-bot`, `Graphviz` for rendering, and `Pillow` for watermarking.

I would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, feature ideas, or bug reports. And of course, a star ‚≠ê on GitHub would make my day!

 I'm a final year CS student and I've been reading about data storage and storage engines. This is a passion project that I've been working on for the past few months. It is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage engine in Python, built from scratch to understand and implement the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture. The project, which is fully open-source, is explicitly optimized for write-heavy workloads. 



# Core Architecture:

The engine implements the three fundamental LSM components: the **Write Ahead Log (WAL)** for durability, an in-memory **Memtable** (using `SortedDict` for sorted writes), and immutable persistent **SSTables (Sorted String Tables)**.

Some features that I'm proud of:

* **Async Compaction**: Merging and compaction are handled by a **separate background worker thread**. The process itself takes a hybrid approach.
* **Client/Server Model**: The entire storage engine runs behind a **FastAPI server**. This allows multiple clients to connect via REST APIs or the included CLI tool.
* **Efficient Range Queries**: Added full support for range queries from `start_key` to `end_key`. This is achieved via a memory-efficient **k-way merge iterator** that combines results from the Memtable and all SSTables. The FastAPI server delivers the results using a `StreamingResponse` to prevent memory exhaustion for large result sets.
* **Bloom Filter**: Implemented a **Bloom Filter** for each SSTable to drastically reduce disk I/O by confirming that a key definitely does not exist before attempting a disk seek.
* **Binary Storage**: SSTables now use **Msgpack binary format** instead of JSON for smaller file sizes and reduced CPU load during serialization/deserialization.

My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.

# Get Started

    pip install lsm_storage_engine_key_value_store

**Usage via CLI/Server:**

1. **Terminal 1 (Server):** `lsm-server`
2. **Terminal 2 (Client):** `lsm-cli` (Follow the CLI help for commands).

# Looking for Feedback

I'd love to hear your thoughts about this implementation and how I can make it better and what features I can add in later versions. Ideas and constructive criticism are always welcome. I'm also looking for contributors, if anyone is interested, please feel free to PM and we can discuss.

I‚Äôve always struggled to get data scientists and analysts to scale their code in the cloud. Almost every time, they‚Äôd have to hand it over to DevOps, the backlog would grow, and overall throughput would tank.

So I built **Burla**, the simplest cluster compute software that lets even Python beginners run code on massive clusters in the cloud. It‚Äôs one function with two parameters: the function and the inputs. You can bring your own Docker image, set hardware requirements, and run jobs as background tasks so you can fire and forget. Responses are fast, and you can call a million simple functions in just a few seconds.

Burla is built for embarrassingly parallel workloads like preprocessing data, hyperparameter tuning, and batch inference.

# Target Audience

Engineers, data scientists, and analysts who want to scale their code in production or research environments without dealing with infrastructure.

# Comparison

Unlike Ray or Dask, Burla doesn‚Äôt require cluster setup, orchestration, or YAML configs. It‚Äôs just:

    from burla import remote_parallel_map
    remote_parallel_map(func, inputs)
    

That‚Äôs it. It automatically handles distribution, retries, logging, and scaling across up to 10,000 VMs.

# Open Source & Free Credits

Burla is open source, and I‚Äôm improving the installation process. I also created managed versions for testing. If you want to try it, I‚Äôll cover 1,000 CPU hours and 100 GPU hours. Email me at [joe@burla.dev]() if interested.

Hey everyone!

Like many of you, I often need to quickly visualize an idea ‚Äì sketch out a project structure, a mind map, or just explain a concept. Every time, I had to open heavy editors like Miro or Figma, which felt like overkill.

So, I decided to build a tool that lives right inside the app I use for communication all day: Telegram.

I'm excited to share my side project: **Diagrammer Bot**. It's a simple yet powerful bot in Python that lets you create diagrams on the fly.

**Here are the key features:**
*   **Text & Image Nodes:** You can create blocks not just from text, but from any image you send.
*   **Full Editing:** Create, connect, edit, and delete both nodes and edges.
*   **Project System:** Save your diagrams with custom names, load them later, or start new ones.
*   **Themes & Export:** Switch between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode. Export your final diagram as a high-quality PNG.
*   **Open-Source:** The entire project is available on GitHub!

**Tech Stack:** Python, `python-telegram-bot`, `Graphviz` for rendering, and `Pillow` for watermarking.

I would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, feature ideas, or bug reports. And of course, a star ‚≠ê on GitHub would make my day!

 I'm a final year CS student and I've been reading about data storage and storage engines. This is a passion project that I've been working on for the past few months. It is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage engine in Python, built from scratch to understand and implement the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture. The project, which is fully open-source, is explicitly optimized for write-heavy workloads. 



# Core Architecture:

The engine implements the three fundamental LSM components: the **Write Ahead Log (WAL)** for durability, an in-memory **Memtable** (using `SortedDict` for sorted writes), and immutable persistent **SSTables (Sorted String Tables)**.

Some features that I'm proud of:

* **Async Compaction**: Merging and compaction are handled by a **separate background worker thread**. The process itself takes a hybrid approach.
* **Client/Server Model**: The entire storage engine runs behind a **FastAPI server**. This allows multiple clients to connect via REST APIs or the included CLI tool.
* **Efficient Range Queries**: Added full support for range queries from `start_key` to `end_key`. This is achieved via a memory-efficient **k-way merge iterator** that combines results from the Memtable and all SSTables. The FastAPI server delivers the results using a `StreamingResponse` to prevent memory exhaustion for large result sets.
* **Bloom Filter**: Implemented a **Bloom Filter** for each SSTable to drastically reduce disk I/O by confirming that a key definitely does not exist before attempting a disk seek.
* **Binary Storage**: SSTables now use **Msgpack binary format** instead of JSON for smaller file sizes and reduced CPU load during serialization/deserialization.

My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.

# Get Started

    pip install lsm_storage_engine_key_value_store

**Usage via CLI/Server:**

1. **Terminal 1 (Server):** `lsm-server`
2. **Terminal 2 (Client):** `lsm-cli` (Follow the CLI help for commands).

# Looking for Feedback

I'd love to hear your thoughts about this implementation and how I can make it better and what features I can add in later versions. Ideas and constructive criticism are always welcome. I'm also looking for contributors, if anyone is interested, please feel free to PM and we can discuss.

Since then, I've been working hard on the suggestions and added some major features.

**What it does (quick reminder):**
Turn any Python function into a web UI with zero boilerplate:

```python
from func_to_web import run

def divide(a: int, b: int):
    return a / b

run(divide)  # Web form at localhost:8000
```

**Major updates since v0.1:**

**Dynamic Lists** ‚Äì Add/remove items with advanced validation:
```python
def process_data(
    # Dynamic lists with add/remove buttons
    images: list[ImageFile],                      # Multiple file uploads
    
    # Dual validation: list size AND individual items
    scores: Annotated[
        list[Annotated[int, Field(ge=0, le=100)]], 
        Field(min_length=3, max_length=10)
    ],  # 3-10 items required, each 0-100
    
    # Optional fields with toggle switches
    notes: str | None = None,                     # Optional text
    tags: list[str] | None = None                 # Optional list
):
    return FileResponse(generate_pdf(), ""report.pdf"")  # Auto-download
```

**High-Performance File Handling** ‚Äì Optimized streaming for large files:
- **Upload**: Real-time progress bars, 8MB chunks, handles GB+ files
- **Download**: Return `FileResponse(data, filename)` for auto-downloads
- **Performance**: ~237 MB/s localhost, ~115 MB/s over Gigabit Ethernet
- **Memory efficient**: Constant usage regardless of file size
- **Any format**: PDF, Excel, ZIP, images, binary data

**Optional Fields** ‚Äì `Type | None` creates toggle switches:
- Fields with defaults start enabled, without defaults start disabled
- Explicit control: `Type | OptionalEnabled/OptionalDisabled`
- Works with all types, constraints, and lists

**Dynamic Dropdowns** ‚Äì Runtime-generated options:
```python
def get_themes(): return fetch_from_database()

def configure(theme: Literal[get_themes]): pass  # Fresh options each request
```

**Rich Output Support**:
- **PIL Images**: Auto-displayed in browser
- **Matplotlib plots**: Rendered as PNG
- **File downloads**: Single or multiple files with streaming
- **JSON/text**: Formatted with copy-to-clipboard

**UX Improvements**:
- Dark mode with theme persistence
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Enter to submit)
- Auto-focus first field
- Toast notifications
- Upload progress with speed indicators

**Current stats:**
- 180+ GitHub stars (The chinese community is sharing it too!)
- 454 unit tests
- Published on PyPI: `pip install func-to-web`
- 20+ runnable examples
- Used daily for internal tools at multiple companies

**Other improvements:**
- **Modular architecture**: Code separated by responsibilities (analysis, validation, form building...)
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Every function and class documented
- **Detailed changelog**: Track all improvements and breaking changes

I've tried to make this as professional and production-ready as possible while keeping the simple API.

Still focused on internal tools and rapid prototyping, not replacing proper web frameworks.

So, I decided to build a tool that lives right inside the app I use for communication all day: Telegram.

I'm excited to share my side project: **Diagrammer Bot**. It's a simple yet powerful bot in Python that lets you create diagrams on the fly.

**Here are the key features:**
*   **Text & Image Nodes:** You can create blocks not just from text, but from any image you send.
*   **Full Editing:** Create, connect, edit, and delete both nodes and edges.
*   **Project System:** Save your diagrams with custom names, load them later, or start new ones.
*   **Themes & Export:** Switch between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode. Export your final diagram as a high-quality PNG.
*   **Open-Source:** The entire project is available on GitHub!

**Tech Stack:** Python, `python-telegram-bot`, `Graphviz` for rendering, and `Pillow` for watermarking.

I would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, feature ideas, or bug reports. And of course, a star ‚≠ê on GitHub would make my day!

 I'm a final year CS student and I've been reading about data storage and storage engines. This is a passion project that I've been working on for the past few months. It is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage engine in Python, built from scratch to understand and implement the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture. The project, which is fully open-source, is explicitly optimized for write-heavy workloads. 



# Core Architecture:

The engine implements the three fundamental LSM components: the **Write Ahead Log (WAL)** for durability, an in-memory **Memtable** (using `SortedDict` for sorted writes), and immutable persistent **SSTables (Sorted String Tables)**.

Some features that I'm proud of:

* **Async Compaction**: Merging and compaction are handled by a **separate background worker thread**. The process itself takes a hybrid approach.
* **Client/Server Model**: The entire storage engine runs behind a **FastAPI server**. This allows multiple clients to connect via REST APIs or the included CLI tool.
* **Efficient Range Queries**: Added full support for range queries from `start_key` to `end_key`. This is achieved via a memory-efficient **k-way merge iterator** that combines results from the Memtable and all SSTables. The FastAPI server delivers the results using a `StreamingResponse` to prevent memory exhaustion for large result sets.
* **Bloom Filter**: Implemented a **Bloom Filter** for each SSTable to drastically reduce disk I/O by confirming that a key definitely does not exist before attempting a disk seek.
* **Binary Storage**: SSTables now use **Msgpack binary format** instead of JSON for smaller file sizes and reduced CPU load during serialization/deserialization.

My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.

# Get Started

**Usage via CLI/Server:**

1. **Terminal 1 (Server):** `lsm-server`
2. **Terminal 2 (Client):** `lsm-cli` (Follow the CLI help for commands).

# Looking for Feedback

Since then, I've been working hard on the suggestions and added some major features.

**What it does (quick reminder):**
Turn any Python function into a web UI with zero boilerplate:

```python
from func_to_web import run

def divide(a: int, b: int):
    return a / b

run(divide)  # Web form at localhost:8000
```

**Major updates since v0.1:**

**Dynamic Lists** ‚Äì Add/remove items with advanced validation:
```python
def process_data(
    # Dynamic lists with add/remove buttons
    images: list[ImageFile],                      # Multiple file uploads
    
    # Dual validation: list size AND individual items
    scores: Annotated[
        list[Annotated[int, Field(ge=0, le=100)]], 
        Field(min_length=3, max_length=10)
    ],  # 3-10 items required, each 0-100
    
    # Optional fields with toggle switches
    notes: str | None = None,                     # Optional text
    tags: list[str] | None = None                 # Optional list
):
    return FileResponse(generate_pdf(), ""report.pdf"")  # Auto-download
```

**High-Performance File Handling** ‚Äì Optimized streaming for large files:
- **Upload**: Real-time progress bars, 8MB chunks, handles GB+ files
- **Download**: Return `FileResponse(data, filename)` for auto-downloads
- **Performance**: ~237 MB/s localhost, ~115 MB/s over Gigabit Ethernet
- **Memory efficient**: Constant usage regardless of file size
- **Any format**: PDF, Excel, ZIP, images, binary data

**Optional Fields** ‚Äì `Type | None` creates toggle switches:
- Fields with defaults start enabled, without defaults start disabled
- Explicit control: `Type | OptionalEnabled/OptionalDisabled`
- Works with all types, constraints, and lists

**Dynamic Dropdowns** ‚Äì Runtime-generated options:
```python
def get_themes(): return fetch_from_database()

def configure(theme: Literal[get_themes]): pass  # Fresh options each request
```

**Rich Output Support**:
- **PIL Images**: Auto-displayed in browser
- **Matplotlib plots**: Rendered as PNG
- **File downloads**: Single or multiple files with streaming
- **JSON/text**: Formatted with copy-to-clipboard

**UX Improvements**:
- Dark mode with theme persistence
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Enter to submit)
- Auto-focus first field
- Toast notifications
- Upload progress with speed indicators

**Current stats:**
- 180+ GitHub stars (The chinese community is sharing it too!)
- 454 unit tests
- Published on PyPI: `pip install func-to-web`
- 20+ runnable examples
- Used daily for internal tools at multiple companies

**Other improvements:**
- **Modular architecture**: Code separated by responsibilities (analysis, validation, form building...)
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Every function and class documented
- **Detailed changelog**: Track all improvements and breaking changes

I've tried to make this as professional and production-ready as possible while keeping the simple API.

Still focused on internal tools and rapid prototyping, not replacing proper web frameworks.

What My Project Does:

* Produces low-level, inspectable output so you can see how program logic maps to in-game command-block logic.
* Implemented in Python for readability and easy contribution.

Target Audience:

* Minecraft command-block creators who want to run low-level programs without mods.
* Hobbyist compiler writers and learners looking for a compact Python codegen example.
* Contributors interested in parsing, code generation, testing strategies, or command optimization.
* This is an educational/hobby tool for small demos and experiments ‚Äî not a production compiler for large-scale programs.

Comparison (how it differs from alternatives):

* Assembly-focused: unlike high-level language‚ÜíMinecraft tools, it targets an assembly-like input so outputs are low-level and easy to debug in command blocks.
* Python-first and lightweight: prioritizes clarity and contributor-friendliness over performance.
* Command-block oriented: designed to work with vanilla in-game command blocks (does not target datapacks or mods).

How to help:

* Test: run examples, try outputs in a world, and note Minecraft version and exact steps when something fails.
* Report: open issues with minimal reproduction files and steps.
* Contribute: PRs welcome for bug fixes, examples, optimizations, docs, or tests ‚Äî look for good-first-issue.",2025-10-21T09:08:12.065459

I‚Äôve always struggled to get data scientists and analysts to scale their code in the cloud. Almost every time, they‚Äôd have to hand it over to DevOps, the backlog would grow, and overall throughput would tank.

So I built **Burla**, the simplest cluster compute software that lets even Python beginners run code on massive clusters in the cloud. It‚Äôs one function with two parameters: the function and the inputs. You can bring your own Docker image, set hardware requirements, and run jobs as background tasks so you can fire and forget. Responses are fast, and you can call a million simple functions in just a few seconds.

Burla is built for embarrassingly parallel workloads like preprocessing data, hyperparameter tuning, and batch inference.

# Target Audience

Engineers, data scientists, and analysts who want to scale their code in production or research environments without dealing with infrastructure.

# Comparison

Unlike Ray or Dask, Burla doesn‚Äôt require cluster setup, orchestration, or YAML configs. It‚Äôs just:

    from burla import remote_parallel_map
    remote_parallel_map(func, inputs)
    

That‚Äôs it. It automatically handles distribution, retries, logging, and scaling across up to 10,000 VMs.

# Open Source & Free Credits

Burla is open source, and I‚Äôm improving the installation process. I also created managed versions for testing. If you want to try it, I‚Äôll cover 1,000 CPU hours and 100 GPU hours. Email me at [joe@burla.dev]() if interested.

I‚Äôve always struggled to get data scientists and analysts to scale their code in the cloud. Almost every time, they‚Äôd have to hand it over to DevOps, the backlog would grow, and overall throughput would tank.

So I built **Burla**, the simplest cluster compute software that lets even Python beginners run code on massive clusters in the cloud. It‚Äôs one function with two parameters: the function and the inputs. You can bring your own Docker image, set hardware requirements, and run jobs as background tasks so you can fire and forget. Responses are fast, and you can call a million simple functions in just a few seconds.

Burla is built for embarrassingly parallel workloads like preprocessing data, hyperparameter tuning, and batch inference.

# Target Audience

Engineers, data scientists, and analysts who want to scale their code in production or research environments without dealing with infrastructure.

# Comparison

Unlike Ray or Dask, Burla doesn‚Äôt require cluster setup, orchestration, or YAML configs. It‚Äôs just:

    from burla import remote_parallel_map
    remote_parallel_map(func, inputs)
    

That‚Äôs it. It automatically handles distribution, retries, logging, and scaling across up to 10,000 VMs.

# Open Source & Free Credits

Burla is open source, and I‚Äôm improving the installation process. I also created managed versions for testing. If you want to try it, I‚Äôll cover 1,000 CPU hours and 100 GPU hours. Email me at [joe@burla.dev]() if interested.

Hey everyone!

Like many of you, I often need to quickly visualize an idea ‚Äì sketch out a project structure, a mind map, or just explain a concept. Every time, I had to open heavy editors like Miro or Figma, which felt like overkill.

So, I decided to build a tool that lives right inside the app I use for communication all day: Telegram.

I'm excited to share my side project: **Diagrammer Bot**. It's a simple yet powerful bot in Python that lets you create diagrams on the fly.

**Here are the key features:**
*   **Text & Image Nodes:** You can create blocks not just from text, but from any image you send.
*   **Full Editing:** Create, connect, edit, and delete both nodes and edges.
*   **Project System:** Save your diagrams with custom names, load them later, or start new ones.
*   **Themes & Export:** Switch between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode. Export your final diagram as a high-quality PNG.
*   **Open-Source:** The entire project is available on GitHub!

**Tech Stack:** Python, `python-telegram-bot`, `Graphviz` for rendering, and `Pillow` for watermarking.

I would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, feature ideas, or bug reports. And of course, a star ‚≠ê on GitHub would make my day!

 I'm a final year CS student and I've been reading about data storage and storage engines. This is a passion project that I've been working on for the past few months. It is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage engine in Python, built from scratch to understand and implement the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture. The project, which is fully open-source, is explicitly optimized for write-heavy workloads. 



# Core Architecture:

The engine implements the three fundamental LSM components: the **Write Ahead Log (WAL)** for durability, an in-memory **Memtable** (using `SortedDict` for sorted writes), and immutable persistent **SSTables (Sorted String Tables)**.

Some features that I'm proud of:

* **Async Compaction**: Merging and compaction are handled by a **separate background worker thread**. The process itself takes a hybrid approach.
* **Client/Server Model**: The entire storage engine runs behind a **FastAPI server**. This allows multiple clients to connect via REST APIs or the included CLI tool.
* **Efficient Range Queries**: Added full support for range queries from `start_key` to `end_key`. This is achieved via a memory-efficient **k-way merge iterator** that combines results from the Memtable and all SSTables. The FastAPI server delivers the results using a `StreamingResponse` to prevent memory exhaustion for large result sets.
* **Bloom Filter**: Implemented a **Bloom Filter** for each SSTable to drastically reduce disk I/O by confirming that a key definitely does not exist before attempting a disk seek.
* **Binary Storage**: SSTables now use **Msgpack binary format** instead of JSON for smaller file sizes and reduced CPU load during serialization/deserialization.

My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.

# Get Started

    pip install lsm_storage_engine_key_value_store

**Usage via CLI/Server:**

1. **Terminal 1 (Server):** `lsm-server`
2. **Terminal 2 (Client):** `lsm-cli` (Follow the CLI help for commands).

# Looking for Feedback

I'd love to hear your thoughts about this implementation and how I can make it better and what features I can add in later versions. Ideas and constructive criticism are always welcome. I'm also looking for contributors, if anyone is interested, please feel free to PM and we can discuss.

I‚Äôve always struggled to get data scientists and analysts to scale their code in the cloud. Almost every time, they‚Äôd have to hand it over to DevOps, the backlog would grow, and overall throughput would tank.

So I built **Burla**, the simplest cluster compute software that lets even Python beginners run code on massive clusters in the cloud. It‚Äôs one function with two parameters: the function and the inputs. You can bring your own Docker image, set hardware requirements, and run jobs as background tasks so you can fire and forget. Responses are fast, and you can call a million simple functions in just a few seconds.

Burla is built for embarrassingly parallel workloads like preprocessing data, hyperparameter tuning, and batch inference.

# Target Audience

Engineers, data scientists, and analysts who want to scale their code in production or research environments without dealing with infrastructure.

# Comparison

Unlike Ray or Dask, Burla doesn‚Äôt require cluster setup, orchestration, or YAML configs. It‚Äôs just:

    from burla import remote_parallel_map
    remote_parallel_map(func, inputs)
    

That‚Äôs it. It automatically handles distribution, retries, logging, and scaling across up to 10,000 VMs.

# Open Source & Free Credits

Burla is open source, and I‚Äôm improving the installation process. I also created managed versions for testing. If you want to try it, I‚Äôll cover 1,000 CPU hours and 100 GPU hours. Email me at [joe@burla.dev]() if interested.

Hey everyone!

Like many of you, I often need to quickly visualize an idea ‚Äì sketch out a project structure, a mind map, or just explain a concept. Every time, I had to open heavy editors like Miro or Figma, which felt like overkill.

So, I decided to build a tool that lives right inside the app I use for communication all day: Telegram.

I'm excited to share my side project: **Diagrammer Bot**. It's a simple yet powerful bot in Python that lets you create diagrams on the fly.

**Here are the key features:**
*   **Text & Image Nodes:** You can create blocks not just from text, but from any image you send.
*   **Full Editing:** Create, connect, edit, and delete both nodes and edges.
*   **Project System:** Save your diagrams with custom names, load them later, or start new ones.
*   **Themes & Export:** Switch between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode. Export your final diagram as a high-quality PNG.
*   **Open-Source:** The entire project is available on GitHub!

**Tech Stack:** Python, `python-telegram-bot`, `Graphviz` for rendering, and `Pillow` for watermarking.

I would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, feature ideas, or bug reports. And of course, a star ‚≠ê on GitHub would make my day!

 I'm a final year CS student and I've been reading about data storage and storage engines. This is a passion project that I've been working on for the past few months. It is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage engine in Python, built from scratch to understand and implement the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture. The project, which is fully open-source, is explicitly optimized for write-heavy workloads. 



# Core Architecture:

The engine implements the three fundamental LSM components: the **Write Ahead Log (WAL)** for durability, an in-memory **Memtable** (using `SortedDict` for sorted writes), and immutable persistent **SSTables (Sorted String Tables)**.

Some features that I'm proud of:

* **Async Compaction**: Merging and compaction are handled by a **separate background worker thread**. The process itself takes a hybrid approach.
* **Client/Server Model**: The entire storage engine runs behind a **FastAPI server**. This allows multiple clients to connect via REST APIs or the included CLI tool.
* **Efficient Range Queries**: Added full support for range queries from `start_key` to `end_key`. This is achieved via a memory-efficient **k-way merge iterator** that combines results from the Memtable and all SSTables. The FastAPI server delivers the results using a `StreamingResponse` to prevent memory exhaustion for large result sets.
* **Bloom Filter**: Implemented a **Bloom Filter** for each SSTable to drastically reduce disk I/O by confirming that a key definitely does not exist before attempting a disk seek.
* **Binary Storage**: SSTables now use **Msgpack binary format** instead of JSON for smaller file sizes and reduced CPU load during serialization/deserialization.

My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.

# Get Started

    pip install lsm_storage_engine_key_value_store

**Usage via CLI/Server:**

1. **Terminal 1 (Server):** `lsm-server`
2. **Terminal 2 (Client):** `lsm-cli` (Follow the CLI help for commands).

# Looking for Feedback

I'd love to hear your thoughts about this implementation and how I can make it better and what features I can add in later versions. Ideas and constructive criticism are always welcome. I'm also looking for contributors, if anyone is interested, please feel free to PM and we can discuss.

Since then, I've been working hard on the suggestions and added some major features.

**What it does (quick reminder):**
Turn any Python function into a web UI with zero boilerplate:

```python
from func_to_web import run

def divide(a: int, b: int):
    return a / b

run(divide)  # Web form at localhost:8000
```

**Major updates since v0.1:**

**Dynamic Lists** ‚Äì Add/remove items with advanced validation:
```python
def process_data(
    # Dynamic lists with add/remove buttons
    images: list[ImageFile],                      # Multiple file uploads
    
    # Dual validation: list size AND individual items
    scores: Annotated[
        list[Annotated[int, Field(ge=0, le=100)]], 
        Field(min_length=3, max_length=10)
    ],  # 3-10 items required, each 0-100
    
    # Optional fields with toggle switches
    notes: str | None = None,                     # Optional text
    tags: list[str] | None = None                 # Optional list
):
    return FileResponse(generate_pdf(), ""report.pdf"")  # Auto-download
```

**High-Performance File Handling** ‚Äì Optimized streaming for large files:
- **Upload**: Real-time progress bars, 8MB chunks, handles GB+ files
- **Download**: Return `FileResponse(data, filename)` for auto-downloads
- **Performance**: ~237 MB/s localhost, ~115 MB/s over Gigabit Ethernet
- **Memory efficient**: Constant usage regardless of file size
- **Any format**: PDF, Excel, ZIP, images, binary data

**Optional Fields** ‚Äì `Type | None` creates toggle switches:
- Fields with defaults start enabled, without defaults start disabled
- Explicit control: `Type | OptionalEnabled/OptionalDisabled`
- Works with all types, constraints, and lists

**Dynamic Dropdowns** ‚Äì Runtime-generated options:
```python
def get_themes(): return fetch_from_database()

def configure(theme: Literal[get_themes]): pass  # Fresh options each request
```

**Rich Output Support**:
- **PIL Images**: Auto-displayed in browser
- **Matplotlib plots**: Rendered as PNG
- **File downloads**: Single or multiple files with streaming
- **JSON/text**: Formatted with copy-to-clipboard

**UX Improvements**:
- Dark mode with theme persistence
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Enter to submit)
- Auto-focus first field
- Toast notifications
- Upload progress with speed indicators

**Current stats:**
- 180+ GitHub stars (The chinese community is sharing it too!)
- 454 unit tests
- Published on PyPI: `pip install func-to-web`
- 20+ runnable examples
- Used daily for internal tools at multiple companies

**Other improvements:**
- **Modular architecture**: Code separated by responsibilities (analysis, validation, form building...)
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Every function and class documented
- **Detailed changelog**: Track all improvements and breaking changes

I've tried to make this as professional and production-ready as possible while keeping the simple API.

Still focused on internal tools and rapid prototyping, not replacing proper web frameworks.

Target Audience:

* Minecraft command-block creators who want to run low-level programs without mods.
* Hobbyist compiler writers and learners looking for a compact Python codegen example.
* Contributors interested in parsing, code generation, testing strategies, or command optimization.
* This is an educational/hobby tool for small demos and experiments ‚Äî not a production compiler for large-scale programs.

Comparison (how it differs from alternatives):

* Assembly-focused: unlike high-level language‚ÜíMinecraft tools, it targets an assembly-like input so outputs are low-level and easy to debug in command blocks.
* Python-first and lightweight: prioritizes clarity and contributor-friendliness over performance.
* Command-block oriented: designed to work with vanilla in-game command blocks (does not target datapacks or mods).

How to help:

 I'm a final year CS student and I've been reading about data storage and storage engines. This is a passion project that I've been working on for the past few months. It is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage engine in Python, built from scratch to understand and implement the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture. The project, which is fully open-source, is explicitly optimized for write-heavy workloads. 



# Core Architecture:

The engine implements the three fundamental LSM components: the **Write Ahead Log (WAL)** for durability, an in-memory **Memtable** (using `SortedDict` for sorted writes), and immutable persistent **SSTables (Sorted String Tables)**.

Some features that I'm proud of:

* **Async Compaction**: Merging and compaction are handled by a **separate background worker thread**. The process itself takes a hybrid approach.
* **Client/Server Model**: The entire storage engine runs behind a **FastAPI server**. This allows multiple clients to connect via REST APIs or the included CLI tool.
* **Efficient Range Queries**: Added full support for range queries from `start_key` to `end_key`. This is achieved via a memory-efficient **k-way merge iterator** that combines results from the Memtable and all SSTables. The FastAPI server delivers the results using a `StreamingResponse` to prevent memory exhaustion for large result sets.
* **Bloom Filter**: Implemented a **Bloom Filter** for each SSTable to drastically reduce disk I/O by confirming that a key definitely does not exist before attempting a disk seek.
* **Binary Storage**: SSTables now use **Msgpack binary format** instead of JSON for smaller file sizes and reduced CPU load during serialization/deserialization.

My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.

# Get Started

    pip install lsm_storage_engine_key_value_store

**Usage via CLI/Server:**

1. **Terminal 1 (Server):** `lsm-server`
2. **Terminal 2 (Client):** `lsm-cli` (Follow the CLI help for commands).

# Looking for Feedback

I'd love to hear your thoughts about this implementation and how I can make it better and what features I can add in later versions. Ideas and constructive criticism are always welcome. I'm also looking for contributors, if anyone is interested, please feel free to PM and we can discuss.

I‚Äôve always struggled to get data scientists and analysts to scale their code in the cloud. Almost every time, they‚Äôd have to hand it over to DevOps, the backlog would grow, and overall throughput would tank.

So I built **Burla**, the simplest cluster compute software that lets even Python beginners run code on massive clusters in the cloud. It‚Äôs one function with two parameters: the function and the inputs. You can bring your own Docker image, set hardware requirements, and run jobs as background tasks so you can fire and forget. Responses are fast, and you can call a million simple functions in just a few seconds.

Burla is built for embarrassingly parallel workloads like preprocessing data, hyperparameter tuning, and batch inference.

# Target Audience

Engineers, data scientists, and analysts who want to scale their code in production or research environments without dealing with infrastructure.

# Comparison

Unlike Ray or Dask, Burla doesn‚Äôt require cluster setup, orchestration, or YAML configs. It‚Äôs just:

    from burla import remote_parallel_map
    remote_parallel_map(func, inputs)
    

That‚Äôs it. It automatically handles distribution, retries, logging, and scaling across up to 10,000 VMs.

# Open Source & Free Credits

Burla is open source, and I‚Äôm improving the installation process. I also created managed versions for testing. If you want to try it, I‚Äôll cover 1,000 CPU hours and 100 GPU hours. Email me at [joe@burla.dev]() if interested.

Hey everyone!

Like many of you, I often need to quickly visualize an idea ‚Äì sketch out a project structure, a mind map, or just explain a concept. Every time, I had to open heavy editors like Miro or Figma, which felt like overkill.

So, I decided to build a tool that lives right inside the app I use for communication all day: Telegram.

I'm excited to share my side project: **Diagrammer Bot**. It's a simple yet powerful bot in Python that lets you create diagrams on the fly.

**Here are the key features:**
*   **Text & Image Nodes:** You can create blocks not just from text, but from any image you send.
*   **Full Editing:** Create, connect, edit, and delete both nodes and edges.
*   **Project System:** Save your diagrams with custom names, load them later, or start new ones.
*   **Themes & Export:** Switch between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode. Export your final diagram as a high-quality PNG.
*   **Open-Source:** The entire project is available on GitHub!

**Tech Stack:** Python, `python-telegram-bot`, `Graphviz` for rendering, and `Pillow` for watermarking.

I would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, feature ideas, or bug reports. And of course, a star ‚≠ê on GitHub would make my day!

I‚Äôve always struggled to get data scientists and analysts to scale their code in the cloud. Almost every time, they‚Äôd have to hand it over to DevOps, the backlog would grow, and overall throughput would tank.

So I built **Burla**, the simplest cluster compute software that lets even Python beginners run code on massive clusters in the cloud. It‚Äôs one function with two parameters: the function and the inputs. You can bring your own Docker image, set hardware requirements, and run jobs as background tasks so you can fire and forget. Responses are fast, and you can call a million simple functions in just a few seconds.

Burla is built for embarrassingly parallel workloads like preprocessing data, hyperparameter tuning, and batch inference.

# Target Audience

Engineers, data scientists, and analysts who want to scale their code in production or research environments without dealing with infrastructure.

# Comparison

Unlike Ray or Dask, Burla doesn‚Äôt require cluster setup, orchestration, or YAML configs. It‚Äôs just:

    from burla import remote_parallel_map
    remote_parallel_map(func, inputs)
    

That‚Äôs it. It automatically handles distribution, retries, logging, and scaling across up to 10,000 VMs.

# Open Source & Free Credits

Burla is open source, and I‚Äôm improving the installation process. I also created managed versions for testing. If you want to try it, I‚Äôll cover 1,000 CPU hours and 100 GPU hours. Email me at [joe@burla.dev]() if interested.

Hey everyone!

Like many of you, I often need to quickly visualize an idea ‚Äì sketch out a project structure, a mind map, or just explain a concept. Every time, I had to open heavy editors like Miro or Figma, which felt like overkill.

So, I decided to build a tool that lives right inside the app I use for communication all day: Telegram.

I'm excited to share my side project: **Diagrammer Bot**. It's a simple yet powerful bot in Python that lets you create diagrams on the fly.

**Here are the key features:**
*   **Text & Image Nodes:** You can create blocks not just from text, but from any image you send.
*   **Full Editing:** Create, connect, edit, and delete both nodes and edges.
*   **Project System:** Save your diagrams with custom names, load them later, or start new ones.
*   **Themes & Export:** Switch between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode. Export your final diagram as a high-quality PNG.
*   **Open-Source:** The entire project is available on GitHub!

**Tech Stack:** Python, `python-telegram-bot`, `Graphviz` for rendering, and `Pillow` for watermarking.

I would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, feature ideas, or bug reports. And of course, a star ‚≠ê on GitHub would make my day!

 I'm a final year CS student and I've been reading about data storage and storage engines. This is a passion project that I've been working on for the past few months. It is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage engine in Python, built from scratch to understand and implement the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture. The project, which is fully open-source, is explicitly optimized for write-heavy workloads. 



# Core Architecture:

The engine implements the three fundamental LSM components: the **Write Ahead Log (WAL)** for durability, an in-memory **Memtable** (using `SortedDict` for sorted writes), and immutable persistent **SSTables (Sorted String Tables)**.

Some features that I'm proud of:

* **Async Compaction**: Merging and compaction are handled by a **separate background worker thread**. The process itself takes a hybrid approach.
* **Client/Server Model**: The entire storage engine runs behind a **FastAPI server**. This allows multiple clients to connect via REST APIs or the included CLI tool.
* **Efficient Range Queries**: Added full support for range queries from `start_key` to `end_key`. This is achieved via a memory-efficient **k-way merge iterator** that combines results from the Memtable and all SSTables. The FastAPI server delivers the results using a `StreamingResponse` to prevent memory exhaustion for large result sets.
* **Bloom Filter**: Implemented a **Bloom Filter** for each SSTable to drastically reduce disk I/O by confirming that a key definitely does not exist before attempting a disk seek.
* **Binary Storage**: SSTables now use **Msgpack binary format** instead of JSON for smaller file sizes and reduced CPU load during serialization/deserialization.

My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.

# Get Started

    pip install lsm_storage_engine_key_value_store

**Usage via CLI/Server:**

1. **Terminal 1 (Server):** `lsm-server`
2. **Terminal 2 (Client):** `lsm-cli` (Follow the CLI help for commands).

# Looking for Feedback

I'd love to hear your thoughts about this implementation and how I can make it better and what features I can add in later versions. Ideas and constructive criticism are always welcome. I'm also looking for contributors, if anyone is interested, please feel free to PM and we can discuss.

* Python-first and lightweight: prioritizes clarity and contributor-friendliness over performance.
* Command-block oriented: designed to work with vanilla in-game command blocks (does not target datapacks or mods).

How to help:

I‚Äôve always struggled to get data scientists and analysts to scale their code in the cloud. Almost every time, they‚Äôd have to hand it over to DevOps, the backlog would grow, and overall throughput would tank.

So I built **Burla**, the simplest cluster compute software that lets even Python beginners run code on massive clusters in the cloud. It‚Äôs one function with two parameters: the function and the inputs. You can bring your own Docker image, set hardware requirements, and run jobs as background tasks so you can fire and forget. Responses are fast, and you can call a million simple functions in just a few seconds.

Burla is built for embarrassingly parallel workloads like preprocessing data, hyperparameter tuning, and batch inference.

# Target Audience

Engineers, data scientists, and analysts who want to scale their code in production or research environments without dealing with infrastructure.

# Comparison

Unlike Ray or Dask, Burla doesn‚Äôt require cluster setup, orchestration, or YAML configs. It‚Äôs just:

    from burla import remote_parallel_map
    remote_parallel_map(func, inputs)
    

That‚Äôs it. It automatically handles distribution, retries, logging, and scaling across up to 10,000 VMs.

# Open Source & Free Credits

Burla is open source, and I‚Äôm improving the installation process. I also created managed versions for testing. If you want to try it, I‚Äôll cover 1,000 CPU hours and 100 GPU hours. Email me at [joe@burla.dev]() if interested.

Hey everyone!

Like many of you, I often need to quickly visualize an idea ‚Äì sketch out a project structure, a mind map, or just explain a concept. Every time, I had to open heavy editors like Miro or Figma, which felt like overkill.

So, I decided to build a tool that lives right inside the app I use for communication all day: Telegram.

I'm excited to share my side project: **Diagrammer Bot**. It's a simple yet powerful bot in Python that lets you create diagrams on the fly.

**Here are the key features:**
*   **Text & Image Nodes:** You can create blocks not just from text, but from any image you send.
*   **Full Editing:** Create, connect, edit, and delete both nodes and edges.
*   **Project System:** Save your diagrams with custom names, load them later, or start new ones.
*   **Themes & Export:** Switch between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode. Export your final diagram as a high-quality PNG.
*   **Open-Source:** The entire project is available on GitHub!

**Tech Stack:** Python, `python-telegram-bot`, `Graphviz` for rendering, and `Pillow` for watermarking.

I would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, feature ideas, or bug reports. And of course, a star ‚≠ê on GitHub would make my day!

 I'm a final year CS student and I've been reading about data storage and storage engines. This is a passion project that I've been working on for the past few months. It is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage engine in Python, built from scratch to understand and implement the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture. The project, which is fully open-source, is explicitly optimized for write-heavy workloads. 



# Core Architecture:

The engine implements the three fundamental LSM components: the **Write Ahead Log (WAL)** for durability, an in-memory **Memtable** (using `SortedDict` for sorted writes), and immutable persistent **SSTables (Sorted String Tables)**.

Some features that I'm proud of:

* **Async Compaction**: Merging and compaction are handled by a **separate background worker thread**. The process itself takes a hybrid approach.
* **Client/Server Model**: The entire storage engine runs behind a **FastAPI server**. This allows multiple clients to connect via REST APIs or the included CLI tool.
* **Efficient Range Queries**: Added full support for range queries from `start_key` to `end_key`. This is achieved via a memory-efficient **k-way merge iterator** that combines results from the Memtable and all SSTables. The FastAPI server delivers the results using a `StreamingResponse` to prevent memory exhaustion for large result sets.
* **Bloom Filter**: Implemented a **Bloom Filter** for each SSTable to drastically reduce disk I/O by confirming that a key definitely does not exist before attempting a disk seek.
* **Binary Storage**: SSTables now use **Msgpack binary format** instead of JSON for smaller file sizes and reduced CPU load during serialization/deserialization.

My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.

# Get Started

    pip install lsm_storage_engine_key_value_store

**Usage via CLI/Server:**

1. **Terminal 1 (Server):** `lsm-server`
2. **Terminal 2 (Client):** `lsm-cli` (Follow the CLI help for commands).

# Looking for Feedback

I'd love to hear your thoughts about this implementation and how I can make it better and what features I can add in later versions. Ideas and constructive criticism are always welcome. I'm also looking for contributors, if anyone is interested, please feel free to PM and we can discuss.

Hey everyone!

Like many of you, I often need to quickly visualize an idea ‚Äì sketch out a project structure, a mind map, or just explain a concept. Every time, I had to open heavy editors like Miro or Figma, which felt like overkill.

So, I decided to build a tool that lives right inside the app I use for communication all day: Telegram.

I'm excited to share my side project: **Diagrammer Bot**. It's a simple yet powerful bot in Python that lets you create diagrams on the fly.

**Here are the key features:**
*   **Text & Image Nodes:** You can create blocks not just from text, but from any image you send.
*   **Full Editing:** Create, connect, edit, and delete both nodes and edges.
*   **Project System:** Save your diagrams with custom names, load them later, or start new ones.
*   **Themes & Export:** Switch between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode. Export your final diagram as a high-quality PNG.
*   **Open-Source:** The entire project is available on GitHub!

**Tech Stack:** Python, `python-telegram-bot`, `Graphviz` for rendering, and `Pillow` for watermarking.

I would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, feature ideas, or bug reports. And of course, a star ‚≠ê on GitHub would make my day!

 I'm a final year CS student and I've been reading about data storage and storage engines. This is a passion project that I've been working on for the past few months. It is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage engine in Python, built from scratch to understand and implement the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture. The project, which is fully open-source, is explicitly optimized for write-heavy workloads. 



# Core Architecture:

The engine implements the three fundamental LSM components: the **Write Ahead Log (WAL)** for durability, an in-memory **Memtable** (using `SortedDict` for sorted writes), and immutable persistent **SSTables (Sorted String Tables)**.

Some features that I'm proud of:

* **Async Compaction**: Merging and compaction are handled by a **separate background worker thread**. The process itself takes a hybrid approach.
* **Client/Server Model**: The entire storage engine runs behind a **FastAPI server**. This allows multiple clients to connect via REST APIs or the included CLI tool.
* **Efficient Range Queries**: Added full support for range queries from `start_key` to `end_key`. This is achieved via a memory-efficient **k-way merge iterator** that combines results from the Memtable and all SSTables. The FastAPI server delivers the results using a `StreamingResponse` to prevent memory exhaustion for large result sets.
* **Bloom Filter**: Implemented a **Bloom Filter** for each SSTable to drastically reduce disk I/O by confirming that a key definitely does not exist before attempting a disk seek.
* **Binary Storage**: SSTables now use **Msgpack binary format** instead of JSON for smaller file sizes and reduced CPU load during serialization/deserialization.

My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.

# Get Started

    pip install lsm_storage_engine_key_value_store

**Usage via CLI/Server:**

1. **Terminal 1 (Server):** `lsm-server`
2. **Terminal 2 (Client):** `lsm-cli` (Follow the CLI help for commands).

# Looking for Feedback

I'd love to hear your thoughts about this implementation and how I can make it better and what features I can add in later versions. Ideas and constructive criticism are always welcome. I'm also looking for contributors, if anyone is interested, please feel free to PM and we can discuss.

* Python-first and lightweight: prioritizes clarity and contributor-friendliness over performance.
* Command-block oriented: designed to work with vanilla in-game command blocks (does not target datapacks or mods).

How to help:

I‚Äôve always struggled to get data scientists and analysts to scale their code in the cloud. Almost every time, they‚Äôd have to hand it over to DevOps, the backlog would grow, and overall throughput would tank.

So I built **Burla**, the simplest cluster compute software that lets even Python beginners run code on massive clusters in the cloud. It‚Äôs one function with two parameters: the function and the inputs. You can bring your own Docker image, set hardware requirements, and run jobs as background tasks so you can fire and forget. Responses are fast, and you can call a million simple functions in just a few seconds.

Burla is built for embarrassingly parallel workloads like preprocessing data, hyperparameter tuning, and batch inference.

# Target Audience

Engineers, data scientists, and analysts who want to scale their code in production or research environments without dealing with infrastructure.

# Comparison

Unlike Ray or Dask, Burla doesn‚Äôt require cluster setup, orchestration, or YAML configs. It‚Äôs just:

    from burla import remote_parallel_map
    remote_parallel_map(func, inputs)
    

That‚Äôs it. It automatically handles distribution, retries, logging, and scaling across up to 10,000 VMs.

# Open Source & Free Credits

Burla is open source, and I‚Äôm improving the installation process. I also created managed versions for testing. If you want to try it, I‚Äôll cover 1,000 CPU hours and 100 GPU hours. Email me at [joe@burla.dev]() if interested.

I‚Äôve always struggled to get data scientists and analysts to scale their code in the cloud. Almost every time, they‚Äôd have to hand it over to DevOps, the backlog would grow, and overall throughput would tank.

So I built **Burla**, the simplest cluster compute software that lets even Python beginners run code on massive clusters in the cloud. It‚Äôs one function with two parameters: the function and the inputs. You can bring your own Docker image, set hardware requirements, and run jobs as background tasks so you can fire and forget. Responses are fast, and you can call a million simple functions in just a few seconds.

Burla is built for embarrassingly parallel workloads like preprocessing data, hyperparameter tuning, and batch inference.

# Target Audience

Engineers, data scientists, and analysts who want to scale their code in production or research environments without dealing with infrastructure.

# Comparison

Unlike Ray or Dask, Burla doesn‚Äôt require cluster setup, orchestration, or YAML configs. It‚Äôs just:

    from burla import remote_parallel_map
    remote_parallel_map(func, inputs)
    

That‚Äôs it. It automatically handles distribution, retries, logging, and scaling across up to 10,000 VMs.

# Open Source & Free Credits

Burla is open source, and I‚Äôm improving the installation process. I also created managed versions for testing. If you want to try it, I‚Äôll cover 1,000 CPU hours and 100 GPU hours. Email me at [joe@burla.dev]() if interested.

Hey everyone!

Like many of you, I often need to quickly visualize an idea ‚Äì sketch out a project structure, a mind map, or just explain a concept. Every time, I had to open heavy editors like Miro or Figma, which felt like overkill.

So, I decided to build a tool that lives right inside the app I use for communication all day: Telegram.

I'm excited to share my side project: **Diagrammer Bot**. It's a simple yet powerful bot in Python that lets you create diagrams on the fly.

**Here are the key features:**
*   **Text & Image Nodes:** You can create blocks not just from text, but from any image you send.
*   **Full Editing:** Create, connect, edit, and delete both nodes and edges.
*   **Project System:** Save your diagrams with custom names, load them later, or start new ones.
*   **Themes & Export:** Switch between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode. Export your final diagram as a high-quality PNG.
*   **Open-Source:** The entire project is available on GitHub!

**Tech Stack:** Python, `python-telegram-bot`, `Graphviz` for rendering, and `Pillow` for watermarking.

I would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, feature ideas, or bug reports. And of course, a star ‚≠ê on GitHub would make my day!

 I'm a final year CS student and I've been reading about data storage and storage engines. This is a passion project that I've been working on for the past few months. It is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage engine in Python, built from scratch to understand and implement the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture. The project, which is fully open-source, is explicitly optimized for write-heavy workloads. 



# Core Architecture:

The engine implements the three fundamental LSM components: the **Write Ahead Log (WAL)** for durability, an in-memory **Memtable** (using `SortedDict` for sorted writes), and immutable persistent **SSTables (Sorted String Tables)**.

Some features that I'm proud of:

* **Async Compaction**: Merging and compaction are handled by a **separate background worker thread**. The process itself takes a hybrid approach.
* **Client/Server Model**: The entire storage engine runs behind a **FastAPI server**. This allows multiple clients to connect via REST APIs or the included CLI tool.
* **Efficient Range Queries**: Added full support for range queries from `start_key` to `end_key`. This is achieved via a memory-efficient **k-way merge iterator** that combines results from the Memtable and all SSTables. The FastAPI server delivers the results using a `StreamingResponse` to prevent memory exhaustion for large result sets.
* **Bloom Filter**: Implemented a **Bloom Filter** for each SSTable to drastically reduce disk I/O by confirming that a key definitely does not exist before attempting a disk seek.
* **Binary Storage**: SSTables now use **Msgpack binary format** instead of JSON for smaller file sizes and reduced CPU load during serialization/deserialization.

My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.

# Get Started

    pip install lsm_storage_engine_key_value_store

**Usage via CLI/Server:**

1. **Terminal 1 (Server):** `lsm-server`
2. **Terminal 2 (Client):** `lsm-cli` (Follow the CLI help for commands).

# Looking for Feedback

I'd love to hear your thoughts about this implementation and how I can make it better and what features I can add in later versions. Ideas and constructive criticism are always welcome. I'm also looking for contributors, if anyone is interested, please feel free to PM and we can discuss.

* **Bloom Filter**: Implemented a **Bloom Filter** for each SSTable to drastically reduce disk I/O by confirming that a key definitely does not exist before attempting a disk seek.
* **Binary Storage**: SSTables now use **Msgpack binary format** instead of JSON for smaller file sizes and reduced CPU load during serialization/deserialization.

My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.

I‚Äôve always struggled to get data scientists and analysts to scale their code in the cloud. Almost every time, they‚Äôd have to hand it over to DevOps, the backlog would grow, and overall throughput would tank.

So I built **Burla**, the simplest cluster compute software that lets even Python beginners run code on massive clusters in the cloud. It‚Äôs one function with two parameters: the function and the inputs. You can bring your own Docker image, set hardware requirements, and run jobs as background tasks so you can fire and forget. Responses are fast, and you can call a million simple functions in just a few seconds.

Burla is built for embarrassingly parallel workloads like preprocessing data, hyperparameter tuning, and batch inference.

# Target Audience

Engineers, data scientists, and analysts who want to scale their code in production or research environments without dealing with infrastructure.

# Comparison

Unlike Ray or Dask, Burla doesn‚Äôt require cluster setup, orchestration, or YAML configs. It‚Äôs just:

    from burla import remote_parallel_map
    remote_parallel_map(func, inputs)
    

That‚Äôs it. It automatically handles distribution, retries, logging, and scaling across up to 10,000 VMs.

# Open Source & Free Credits

Burla is open source, and I‚Äôm improving the installation process. I also created managed versions for testing. If you want to try it, I‚Äôll cover 1,000 CPU hours and 100 GPU hours. Email me at [joe@burla.dev]() if interested.

Hey everyone!

Like many of you, I often need to quickly visualize an idea ‚Äì sketch out a project structure, a mind map, or just explain a concept. Every time, I had to open heavy editors like Miro or Figma, which felt like overkill.

So, I decided to build a tool that lives right inside the app I use for communication all day: Telegram.

I'm excited to share my side project: **Diagrammer Bot**. It's a simple yet powerful bot in Python that lets you create diagrams on the fly.

**Here are the key features:**
*   **Text & Image Nodes:** You can create blocks not just from text, but from any image you send.
*   **Full Editing:** Create, connect, edit, and delete both nodes and edges.
*   **Project System:** Save your diagrams with custom names, load them later, or start new ones.
*   **Themes & Export:** Switch between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode. Export your final diagram as a high-quality PNG.
*   **Open-Source:** The entire project is available on GitHub!

**Tech Stack:** Python, `python-telegram-bot`, `Graphviz` for rendering, and `Pillow` for watermarking.

I would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, feature ideas, or bug reports. And of course, a star ‚≠ê on GitHub would make my day!

 I'm a final year CS student and I've been reading about data storage and storage engines. This is a passion project that I've been working on for the past few months. It is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage engine in Python, built from scratch to understand and implement the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture. The project, which is fully open-source, is explicitly optimized for write-heavy workloads. 



# Core Architecture:

The engine implements the three fundamental LSM components: the **Write Ahead Log (WAL)** for durability, an in-memory **Memtable** (using `SortedDict` for sorted writes), and immutable persistent **SSTables (Sorted String Tables)**.

Some features that I'm proud of:

* **Async Compaction**: Merging and compaction are handled by a **separate background worker thread**. The process itself takes a hybrid approach.
* **Client/Server Model**: The entire storage engine runs behind a **FastAPI server**. This allows multiple clients to connect via REST APIs or the included CLI tool.
* **Efficient Range Queries**: Added full support for range queries from `start_key` to `end_key`. This is achieved via a memory-efficient **k-way merge iterator** that combines results from the Memtable and all SSTables. The FastAPI server delivers the results using a `StreamingResponse` to prevent memory exhaustion for large result sets.
* **Bloom Filter**: Implemented a **Bloom Filter** for each SSTable to drastically reduce disk I/O by confirming that a key definitely does not exist before attempting a disk seek.
* **Binary Storage**: SSTables now use **Msgpack binary format** instead of JSON for smaller file sizes and reduced CPU load during serialization/deserialization.

My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.

I‚Äôve always struggled to get data scientists and analysts to scale their code in the cloud. Almost every time, they‚Äôd have to hand it over to DevOps, the backlog would grow, and overall throughput would tank.

So I built **Burla**, the simplest cluster compute software that lets even Python beginners run code on massive clusters in the cloud. It‚Äôs one function with two parameters: the function and the inputs. You can bring your own Docker image, set hardware requirements, and run jobs as background tasks so you can fire and forget. Responses are fast, and you can call a million simple functions in just a few seconds.

Burla is built for embarrassingly parallel workloads like preprocessing data, hyperparameter tuning, and batch inference.

# Target Audience

Engineers, data scientists, and analysts who want to scale their code in production or research environments without dealing with infrastructure.

# Comparison

Unlike Ray or Dask, Burla doesn‚Äôt require cluster setup, orchestration, or YAML configs. It‚Äôs just:

    from burla import remote_parallel_map
    remote_parallel_map(func, inputs)
    

That‚Äôs it. It automatically handles distribution, retries, logging, and scaling across up to 10,000 VMs.

# Open Source & Free Credits

Burla is open source, and I‚Äôm improving the installation process. I also created managed versions for testing. If you want to try it, I‚Äôll cover 1,000 CPU hours and 100 GPU hours. Email me at [joe@burla.dev]() if interested.

Hey everyone!

Like many of you, I often need to quickly visualize an idea ‚Äì sketch out a project structure, a mind map, or just explain a concept. Every time, I had to open heavy editors like Miro or Figma, which felt like overkill.

So, I decided to build a tool that lives right inside the app I use for communication all day: Telegram.

I'm excited to share my side project: **Diagrammer Bot**. It's a simple yet powerful bot in Python that lets you create diagrams on the fly.

**Here are the key features:**
*   **Text & Image Nodes:** You can create blocks not just from text, but from any image you send.
*   **Full Editing:** Create, connect, edit, and delete both nodes and edges.
*   **Project System:** Save your diagrams with custom names, load them later, or start new ones.
*   **Themes & Export:** Switch between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode. Export your final diagram as a high-quality PNG.
*   **Open-Source:** The entire project is available on GitHub!

**Tech Stack:** Python, `python-telegram-bot`, `Graphviz` for rendering, and `Pillow` for watermarking.

I would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, feature ideas, or bug reports. And of course, a star ‚≠ê on GitHub would make my day!

 I'm a final year CS student and I've been reading about data storage and storage engines. This is a passion project that I've been working on for the past few months. It is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage engine in Python, built from scratch to understand and implement the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture. The project, which is fully open-source, is explicitly optimized for write-heavy workloads. 



# Core Architecture:

The engine implements the three fundamental LSM components: the **Write Ahead Log (WAL)** for durability, an in-memory **Memtable** (using `SortedDict` for sorted writes), and immutable persistent **SSTables (Sorted String Tables)**.

Some features that I'm proud of:

* **Async Compaction**: Merging and compaction are handled by a **separate background worker thread**. The process itself takes a hybrid approach.
* **Client/Server Model**: The entire storage engine runs behind a **FastAPI server**. This allows multiple clients to connect via REST APIs or the included CLI tool.
* **Efficient Range Queries**: Added full support for range queries from `start_key` to `end_key`. This is achieved via a memory-efficient **k-way merge iterator** that combines results from the Memtable and all SSTables. The FastAPI server delivers the results using a `StreamingResponse` to prevent memory exhaustion for large result sets.
* **Bloom Filter**: Implemented a **Bloom Filter** for each SSTable to drastically reduce disk I/O by confirming that a key definitely does not exist before attempting a disk seek.
* **Binary Storage**: SSTables now use **Msgpack binary format** instead of JSON for smaller file sizes and reduced CPU load during serialization/deserialization.

My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.

# Get Started

    pip install lsm_storage_engine_key_value_store

**Usage via CLI/Server:**

1. **Terminal 1 (Server):** `lsm-server`
2. **Terminal 2 (Client):** `lsm-cli` (Follow the CLI help for commands).

# Looking for Feedback

I'd love to hear your thoughts about this implementation and how I can make it better and what features I can add in later versions. Ideas and constructive criticism are always welcome. I'm also looking for contributors, if anyone is interested, please feel free to PM and we can discuss.

Target Audience:

* Minecraft command-block creators who want to run low-level programs without mods.
* Hobbyist compiler writers and learners looking for a compact Python codegen example.
* Contributors interested in parsing, code generation, testing strategies, or command optimization.
* This is an educational/hobby tool for small demos and experiments ‚Äî not a production compiler for large-scale programs.

Comparison (how it differs from alternatives):

* Assembly-focused: unlike high-level language‚ÜíMinecraft tools, it targets an assembly-like input so outputs are low-level and easy to debug in command blocks.
* Python-first and lightweight: prioritizes clarity and contributor-friendliness over performance.
* Command-block oriented: designed to work with vanilla in-game command blocks (does not target datapacks or mods).

How to help:

* Test: run examples, try outputs in a world, and note Minecraft version and exact steps when something fails.
* Report: open issues with minimal reproduction files and steps.

I‚Äôve always struggled to get data scientists and analysts to scale their code in the cloud. Almost every time, they‚Äôd have to hand it over to DevOps, the backlog would grow, and overall throughput would tank.

So I built **Burla**, the simplest cluster compute software that lets even Python beginners run code on massive clusters in the cloud. It‚Äôs one function with two parameters: the function and the inputs. You can bring your own Docker image, set hardware requirements, and run jobs as background tasks so you can fire and forget. Responses are fast, and you can call a million simple functions in just a few seconds.

Burla is built for embarrassingly parallel workloads like preprocessing data, hyperparameter tuning, and batch inference.

# Target Audience

Engineers, data scientists, and analysts who want to scale their code in production or research environments without dealing with infrastructure.

# Comparison

Unlike Ray or Dask, Burla doesn‚Äôt require cluster setup, orchestration, or YAML configs. It‚Äôs just:

    from burla import remote_parallel_map
    remote_parallel_map(func, inputs)
    

That‚Äôs it. It automatically handles distribution, retries, logging, and scaling across up to 10,000 VMs.

# Open Source & Free Credits

Burla is open source, and I‚Äôm improving the installation process. I also created managed versions for testing. If you want to try it, I‚Äôll cover 1,000 CPU hours and 100 GPU hours. Email me at [joe@burla.dev]() if interested.

Hey everyone!

Like many of you, I often need to quickly visualize an idea ‚Äì sketch out a project structure, a mind map, or just explain a concept. Every time, I had to open heavy editors like Miro or Figma, which felt like overkill.

So, I decided to build a tool that lives right inside the app I use for communication all day: Telegram.

I'm excited to share my side project: **Diagrammer Bot**. It's a simple yet powerful bot in Python that lets you create diagrams on the fly.

**Here are the key features:**
*   **Text & Image Nodes:** You can create blocks not just from text, but from any image you send.
*   **Full Editing:** Create, connect, edit, and delete both nodes and edges.
*   **Project System:** Save your diagrams with custom names, load them later, or start new ones.
*   **Themes & Export:** Switch between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode. Export your final diagram as a high-quality PNG.
*   **Open-Source:** The entire project is available on GitHub!

**Tech Stack:** Python, `python-telegram-bot`, `Graphviz` for rendering, and `Pillow` for watermarking.

I would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, feature ideas, or bug reports. And of course, a star ‚≠ê on GitHub would make my day!

 I'm a final year CS student and I've been reading about data storage and storage engines. This is a passion project that I've been working on for the past few months. It is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage engine in Python, built from scratch to understand and implement the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture. The project, which is fully open-source, is explicitly optimized for write-heavy workloads. 



# Core Architecture:

The engine implements the three fundamental LSM components: the **Write Ahead Log (WAL)** for durability, an in-memory **Memtable** (using `SortedDict` for sorted writes), and immutable persistent **SSTables (Sorted String Tables)**.

Some features that I'm proud of:

* **Async Compaction**: Merging and compaction are handled by a **separate background worker thread**. The process itself takes a hybrid approach.
* **Client/Server Model**: The entire storage engine runs behind a **FastAPI server**. This allows multiple clients to connect via REST APIs or the included CLI tool.
* **Efficient Range Queries**: Added full support for range queries from `start_key` to `end_key`. This is achieved via a memory-efficient **k-way merge iterator** that combines results from the Memtable and all SSTables. The FastAPI server delivers the results using a `StreamingResponse` to prevent memory exhaustion for large result sets.
* **Bloom Filter**: Implemented a **Bloom Filter** for each SSTable to drastically reduce disk I/O by confirming that a key definitely does not exist before attempting a disk seek.
* **Binary Storage**: SSTables now use **Msgpack binary format** instead of JSON for smaller file sizes and reduced CPU load during serialization/deserialization.

My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.

# Get Started

    pip install lsm_storage_engine_key_value_store

**Usage via CLI/Server:**

1. **Terminal 1 (Server):** `lsm-server`
2. **Terminal 2 (Client):** `lsm-cli` (Follow the CLI help for commands).

# Looking for Feedback

I'd love to hear your thoughts about this implementation and how I can make it better and what features I can add in later versions. Ideas and constructive criticism are always welcome. I'm also looking for contributors, if anyone is interested, please feel free to PM and we can discuss.

Hey everyone!

Like many of you, I often need to quickly visualize an idea ‚Äì sketch out a project structure, a mind map, or just explain a concept. Every time, I had to open heavy editors like Miro or Figma, which felt like overkill.

So, I decided to build a tool that lives right inside the app I use for communication all day: Telegram.

I'm excited to share my side project: **Diagrammer Bot**. It's a simple yet powerful bot in Python that lets you create diagrams on the fly.

**Here are the key features:**
*   **Text & Image Nodes:** You can create blocks not just from text, but from any image you send.
*   **Full Editing:** Create, connect, edit, and delete both nodes and edges.
*   **Project System:** Save your diagrams with custom names, load them later, or start new ones.
*   **Themes & Export:** Switch between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode. Export your final diagram as a high-quality PNG.
*   **Open-Source:** The entire project is available on GitHub!

**Tech Stack:** Python, `python-telegram-bot`, `Graphviz` for rendering, and `Pillow` for watermarking.

I would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, feature ideas, or bug reports. And of course, a star ‚≠ê on GitHub would make my day!

 I'm a final year CS student and I've been reading about data storage and storage engines. This is a passion project that I've been working on for the past few months. It is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage engine in Python, built from scratch to understand and implement the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture. The project, which is fully open-source, is explicitly optimized for write-heavy workloads. 



# Core Architecture:

The engine implements the three fundamental LSM components: the **Write Ahead Log (WAL)** for durability, an in-memory **Memtable** (using `SortedDict` for sorted writes), and immutable persistent **SSTables (Sorted String Tables)**.

Some features that I'm proud of:

* **Async Compaction**: Merging and compaction are handled by a **separate background worker thread**. The process itself takes a hybrid approach.
* **Client/Server Model**: The entire storage engine runs behind a **FastAPI server**. This allows multiple clients to connect via REST APIs or the included CLI tool.
* **Efficient Range Queries**: Added full support for range queries from `start_key` to `end_key`. This is achieved via a memory-efficient **k-way merge iterator** that combines results from the Memtable and all SSTables. The FastAPI server delivers the results using a `StreamingResponse` to prevent memory exhaustion for large result sets.
* **Bloom Filter**: Implemented a **Bloom Filter** for each SSTable to drastically reduce disk I/O by confirming that a key definitely does not exist before attempting a disk seek.
* **Binary Storage**: SSTables now use **Msgpack binary format** instead of JSON for smaller file sizes and reduced CPU load during serialization/deserialization.

My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.

# Get Started

    pip install lsm_storage_engine_key_value_store

**Usage via CLI/Server:**

1. **Terminal 1 (Server):** `lsm-server`
2. **Terminal 2 (Client):** `lsm-cli` (Follow the CLI help for commands).

# Looking for Feedback

I'd love to hear your thoughts about this implementation and how I can make it better and what features I can add in later versions. Ideas and constructive criticism are always welcome. I'm also looking for contributors, if anyone is interested, please feel free to PM and we can discuss.

Target Audience:

* Minecraft command-block creators who want to run low-level programs without mods.
* Hobbyist compiler writers and learners looking for a compact Python codegen example.
* Contributors interested in parsing, code generation, testing strategies, or command optimization.
* This is an educational/hobby tool for small demos and experiments ‚Äî not a production compiler for large-scale programs.

Comparison (how it differs from alternatives):

* Assembly-focused: unlike high-level language‚ÜíMinecraft tools, it targets an assembly-like input so outputs are low-level and easy to debug in command blocks.
* Python-first and lightweight: prioritizes clarity and contributor-friendliness over performance.
* Command-block oriented: designed to work with vanilla in-game command blocks (does not target datapacks or mods).

How to help:

* Test: run examples, try outputs in a world, and note Minecraft version and exact steps when something fails.
* Report: open issues with minimal reproduction files and steps.

I‚Äôve always struggled to get data scientists and analysts to scale their code in the cloud. Almost every time, they‚Äôd have to hand it over to DevOps, the backlog would grow, and overall throughput would tank.

So I built **Burla**, the simplest cluster compute software that lets even Python beginners run code on massive clusters in the cloud. It‚Äôs one function with two parameters: the function and the inputs. You can bring your own Docker image, set hardware requirements, and run jobs as background tasks so you can fire and forget. Responses are fast, and you can call a million simple functions in just a few seconds.

Burla is built for embarrassingly parallel workloads like preprocessing data, hyperparameter tuning, and batch inference.

# Target Audience

Engineers, data scientists, and analysts who want to scale their code in production or research environments without dealing with infrastructure.

# Comparison

Unlike Ray or Dask, Burla doesn‚Äôt require cluster setup, orchestration, or YAML configs. It‚Äôs just:

    from burla import remote_parallel_map
    remote_parallel_map(func, inputs)
    

That‚Äôs it. It automatically handles distribution, retries, logging, and scaling across up to 10,000 VMs.

# Open Source & Free Credits

Burla is open source, and I‚Äôm improving the installation process. I also created managed versions for testing. If you want to try it, I‚Äôll cover 1,000 CPU hours and 100 GPU hours. Email me at [joe@burla.dev]() if interested.

* Contributors interested in parsing, code generation, testing strategies, or command optimization.
* This is an educational/hobby tool for small demos and experiments ‚Äî not a production compiler for large-scale programs.

Comparison (how it differs from alternatives):

* Assembly-focused: unlike high-level language‚ÜíMinecraft tools, it targets an assembly-like input so outputs are low-level and easy to debug in command blocks.
* Python-first and lightweight: prioritizes clarity and contributor-friendliness over performance.
* Command-block oriented: designed to work with vanilla in-game command blocks (does not target datapacks or mods).

How to help:

I‚Äôve always struggled to get data scientists and analysts to scale their code in the cloud. Almost every time, they‚Äôd have to hand it over to DevOps, the backlog would grow, and overall throughput would tank.

So I built **Burla**, the simplest cluster compute software that lets even Python beginners run code on massive clusters in the cloud. It‚Äôs one function with two parameters: the function and the inputs. You can bring your own Docker image, set hardware requirements, and run jobs as background tasks so you can fire and forget. Responses are fast, and you can call a million simple functions in just a few seconds.

Burla is built for embarrassingly parallel workloads like preprocessing data, hyperparameter tuning, and batch inference.

# Target Audience

Engineers, data scientists, and analysts who want to scale their code in production or research environments without dealing with infrastructure.

# Comparison

Unlike Ray or Dask, Burla doesn‚Äôt require cluster setup, orchestration, or YAML configs. It‚Äôs just:

    from burla import remote_parallel_map
    remote_parallel_map(func, inputs)
    

That‚Äôs it. It automatically handles distribution, retries, logging, and scaling across up to 10,000 VMs.

# Open Source & Free Credits

Burla is open source, and I‚Äôm improving the installation process. I also created managed versions for testing. If you want to try it, I‚Äôll cover 1,000 CPU hours and 100 GPU hours. Email me at [joe@burla.dev]() if interested.

Hey everyone!

Like many of you, I often need to quickly visualize an idea ‚Äì sketch out a project structure, a mind map, or just explain a concept. Every time, I had to open heavy editors like Miro or Figma, which felt like overkill.

So, I decided to build a tool that lives right inside the app I use for communication all day: Telegram.

I'm excited to share my side project: **Diagrammer Bot**. It's a simple yet powerful bot in Python that lets you create diagrams on the fly.

**Here are the key features:**
*   **Text & Image Nodes:** You can create blocks not just from text, but from any image you send.
*   **Full Editing:** Create, connect, edit, and delete both nodes and edges.
*   **Project System:** Save your diagrams with custom names, load them later, or start new ones.
*   **Themes & Export:** Switch between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode. Export your final diagram as a high-quality PNG.
*   **Open-Source:** The entire project is available on GitHub!

**Tech Stack:** Python, `python-telegram-bot`, `Graphviz` for rendering, and `Pillow` for watermarking.

I would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, feature ideas, or bug reports. And of course, a star ‚≠ê on GitHub would make my day!

 I'm a final year CS student and I've been reading about data storage and storage engines. This is a passion project that I've been working on for the past few months. It is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage engine in Python, built from scratch to understand and implement the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture. The project, which is fully open-source, is explicitly optimized for write-heavy workloads. 



# Core Architecture:

The engine implements the three fundamental LSM components: the **Write Ahead Log (WAL)** for durability, an in-memory **Memtable** (using `SortedDict` for sorted writes), and immutable persistent **SSTables (Sorted String Tables)**.

Some features that I'm proud of:

* **Async Compaction**: Merging and compaction are handled by a **separate background worker thread**. The process itself takes a hybrid approach.
* **Client/Server Model**: The entire storage engine runs behind a **FastAPI server**. This allows multiple clients to connect via REST APIs or the included CLI tool.
* **Efficient Range Queries**: Added full support for range queries from `start_key` to `end_key`. This is achieved via a memory-efficient **k-way merge iterator** that combines results from the Memtable and all SSTables. The FastAPI server delivers the results using a `StreamingResponse` to prevent memory exhaustion for large result sets.
* **Bloom Filter**: Implemented a **Bloom Filter** for each SSTable to drastically reduce disk I/O by confirming that a key definitely does not exist before attempting a disk seek.
* **Binary Storage**: SSTables now use **Msgpack binary format** instead of JSON for smaller file sizes and reduced CPU load during serialization/deserialization.

My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.

# Get Started

    pip install lsm_storage_engine_key_value_store

**Usage via CLI/Server:**

1. **Terminal 1 (Server):** `lsm-server`
2. **Terminal 2 (Client):** `lsm-cli` (Follow the CLI help for commands).

# Looking for Feedback

I'd love to hear your thoughts about this implementation and how I can make it better and what features I can add in later versions. Ideas and constructive criticism are always welcome. I'm also looking for contributors, if anyone is interested, please feel free to PM and we can discuss.

My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.

I‚Äôve always struggled to get data scientists and analysts to scale their code in the cloud. Almost every time, they‚Äôd have to hand it over to DevOps, the backlog would grow, and overall throughput would tank.

So I built **Burla**, the simplest cluster compute software that lets even Python beginners run code on massive clusters in the cloud. It‚Äôs one function with two parameters: the function and the inputs. You can bring your own Docker image, set hardware requirements, and run jobs as background tasks so you can fire and forget. Responses are fast, and you can call a million simple functions in just a few seconds.

Burla is built for embarrassingly parallel workloads like preprocessing data, hyperparameter tuning, and batch inference.

# Target Audience

Engineers, data scientists, and analysts who want to scale their code in production or research environments without dealing with infrastructure.

# Comparison

Unlike Ray or Dask, Burla doesn‚Äôt require cluster setup, orchestration, or YAML configs. It‚Äôs just:

    from burla import remote_parallel_map
    remote_parallel_map(func, inputs)
    

That‚Äôs it. It automatically handles distribution, retries, logging, and scaling across up to 10,000 VMs.

# Open Source & Free Credits

Burla is open source, and I‚Äôm improving the installation process. I also created managed versions for testing. If you want to try it, I‚Äôll cover 1,000 CPU hours and 100 GPU hours. Email me at [joe@burla.dev]() if interested.

Hey everyone!

Like many of you, I often need to quickly visualize an idea ‚Äì sketch out a project structure, a mind map, or just explain a concept. Every time, I had to open heavy editors like Miro or Figma, which felt like overkill.

So, I decided to build a tool that lives right inside the app I use for communication all day: Telegram.

I'm excited to share my side project: **Diagrammer Bot**. It's a simple yet powerful bot in Python that lets you create diagrams on the fly.

**Here are the key features:**
*   **Text & Image Nodes:** You can create blocks not just from text, but from any image you send.
*   **Full Editing:** Create, connect, edit, and delete both nodes and edges.
*   **Project System:** Save your diagrams with custom names, load them later, or start new ones.
*   **Themes & Export:** Switch between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode. Export your final diagram as a high-quality PNG.
*   **Open-Source:** The entire project is available on GitHub!

**Tech Stack:** Python, `python-telegram-bot`, `Graphviz` for rendering, and `Pillow` for watermarking.

I would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, feature ideas, or bug reports. And of course, a star ‚≠ê on GitHub would make my day!

 I'm a final year CS student and I've been reading about data storage and storage engines. This is a passion project that I've been working on for the past few months. It is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage engine in Python, built from scratch to understand and implement the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture. The project, which is fully open-source, is explicitly optimized for write-heavy workloads. 



# Core Architecture:

The engine implements the three fundamental LSM components: the **Write Ahead Log (WAL)** for durability, an in-memory **Memtable** (using `SortedDict` for sorted writes), and immutable persistent **SSTables (Sorted String Tables)**.

Some features that I'm proud of:

* **Async Compaction**: Merging and compaction are handled by a **separate background worker thread**. The process itself takes a hybrid approach.
* **Client/Server Model**: The entire storage engine runs behind a **FastAPI server**. This allows multiple clients to connect via REST APIs or the included CLI tool.
* **Efficient Range Queries**: Added full support for range queries from `start_key` to `end_key`. This is achieved via a memory-efficient **k-way merge iterator** that combines results from the Memtable and all SSTables. The FastAPI server delivers the results using a `StreamingResponse` to prevent memory exhaustion for large result sets.
* **Bloom Filter**: Implemented a **Bloom Filter** for each SSTable to drastically reduce disk I/O by confirming that a key definitely does not exist before attempting a disk seek.
* **Binary Storage**: SSTables now use **Msgpack binary format** instead of JSON for smaller file sizes and reduced CPU load during serialization/deserialization.

My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.

I‚Äôve always struggled to get data scientists and analysts to scale their code in the cloud. Almost every time, they‚Äôd have to hand it over to DevOps, the backlog would grow, and overall throughput would tank.

So I built **Burla**, the simplest cluster compute software that lets even Python beginners run code on massive clusters in the cloud. It‚Äôs one function with two parameters: the function and the inputs. You can bring your own Docker image, set hardware requirements, and run jobs as background tasks so you can fire and forget. Responses are fast, and you can call a million simple functions in just a few seconds.

Burla is built for embarrassingly parallel workloads like preprocessing data, hyperparameter tuning, and batch inference.

# Target Audience

Engineers, data scientists, and analysts who want to scale their code in production or research environments without dealing with infrastructure.

# Comparison

Unlike Ray or Dask, Burla doesn‚Äôt require cluster setup, orchestration, or YAML configs. It‚Äôs just:

    from burla import remote_parallel_map
    remote_parallel_map(func, inputs)
    

That‚Äôs it. It automatically handles distribution, retries, logging, and scaling across up to 10,000 VMs.

# Open Source & Free Credits

Burla is open source, and I‚Äôm improving the installation process. I also created managed versions for testing. If you want to try it, I‚Äôll cover 1,000 CPU hours and 100 GPU hours. Email me at [joe@burla.dev]() if interested.

Hey everyone!

Like many of you, I often need to quickly visualize an idea ‚Äì sketch out a project structure, a mind map, or just explain a concept. Every time, I had to open heavy editors like Miro or Figma, which felt like overkill.

So, I decided to build a tool that lives right inside the app I use for communication all day: Telegram.

I'm excited to share my side project: **Diagrammer Bot**. It's a simple yet powerful bot in Python that lets you create diagrams on the fly.

**Here are the key features:**
*   **Text & Image Nodes:** You can create blocks not just from text, but from any image you send.
*   **Full Editing:** Create, connect, edit, and delete both nodes and edges.
*   **Project System:** Save your diagrams with custom names, load them later, or start new ones.
*   **Themes & Export:** Switch between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode. Export your final diagram as a high-quality PNG.
*   **Open-Source:** The entire project is available on GitHub!

**Tech Stack:** Python, `python-telegram-bot`, `Graphviz` for rendering, and `Pillow` for watermarking.

I would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, feature ideas, or bug reports. And of course, a star ‚≠ê on GitHub would make my day!

 I'm a final year CS student and I've been reading about data storage and storage engines. This is a passion project that I've been working on for the past few months. It is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage engine in Python, built from scratch to understand and implement the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture. The project, which is fully open-source, is explicitly optimized for write-heavy workloads. 



# Core Architecture:

The engine implements the three fundamental LSM components: the **Write Ahead Log (WAL)** for durability, an in-memory **Memtable** (using `SortedDict` for sorted writes), and immutable persistent **SSTables (Sorted String Tables)**.

Some features that I'm proud of:

* **Async Compaction**: Merging and compaction are handled by a **separate background worker thread**. The process itself takes a hybrid approach.
* **Client/Server Model**: The entire storage engine runs behind a **FastAPI server**. This allows multiple clients to connect via REST APIs or the included CLI tool.
* **Efficient Range Queries**: Added full support for range queries from `start_key` to `end_key`. This is achieved via a memory-efficient **k-way merge iterator** that combines results from the Memtable and all SSTables. The FastAPI server delivers the results using a `StreamingResponse` to prevent memory exhaustion for large result sets.
* **Bloom Filter**: Implemented a **Bloom Filter** for each SSTable to drastically reduce disk I/O by confirming that a key definitely does not exist before attempting a disk seek.
* **Binary Storage**: SSTables now use **Msgpack binary format** instead of JSON for smaller file sizes and reduced CPU load during serialization/deserialization.

My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.

# Get Started

    pip install lsm_storage_engine_key_value_store

**Usage via CLI/Server:**

1. **Terminal 1 (Server):** `lsm-server`
2. **Terminal 2 (Client):** `lsm-cli` (Follow the CLI help for commands).

# Looking for Feedback

I'd love to hear your thoughts about this implementation and how I can make it better and what features I can add in later versions. Ideas and constructive criticism are always welcome. I'm also looking for contributors, if anyone is interested, please feel free to PM and we can discuss.

* Hobbyist compiler writers and learners looking for a compact Python codegen example.
* Contributors interested in parsing, code generation, testing strategies, or command optimization.
* This is an educational/hobby tool for small demos and experiments ‚Äî not a production compiler for large-scale programs.

Comparison (how it differs from alternatives):

* Assembly-focused: unlike high-level language‚ÜíMinecraft tools, it targets an assembly-like input so outputs are low-level and easy to debug in command blocks.
* Python-first and lightweight: prioritizes clarity and contributor-friendliness over performance.
* Command-block oriented: designed to work with vanilla in-game command blocks (does not target datapacks or mods).

How to help:

* Test: run examples, try outputs in a world, and note Minecraft version and exact steps when something fails.
* Report: open issues with minimal reproduction files and steps.

I‚Äôve always struggled to get data scientists and analysts to scale their code in the cloud. Almost every time, they‚Äôd have to hand it over to DevOps, the backlog would grow, and overall throughput would tank.

So I built **Burla**, the simplest cluster compute software that lets even Python beginners run code on massive clusters in the cloud. It‚Äôs one function with two parameters: the function and the inputs. You can bring your own Docker image, set hardware requirements, and run jobs as background tasks so you can fire and forget. Responses are fast, and you can call a million simple functions in just a few seconds.

Burla is built for embarrassingly parallel workloads like preprocessing data, hyperparameter tuning, and batch inference.

# Target Audience

Engineers, data scientists, and analysts who want to scale their code in production or research environments without dealing with infrastructure.

# Comparison

Unlike Ray or Dask, Burla doesn‚Äôt require cluster setup, orchestration, or YAML configs. It‚Äôs just:

    from burla import remote_parallel_map
    remote_parallel_map(func, inputs)
    

That‚Äôs it. It automatically handles distribution, retries, logging, and scaling across up to 10,000 VMs.

# Open Source & Free Credits

Burla is open source, and I‚Äôm improving the installation process. I also created managed versions for testing. If you want to try it, I‚Äôll cover 1,000 CPU hours and 100 GPU hours. Email me at [joe@burla.dev]() if interested.

Hey everyone!

Like many of you, I often need to quickly visualize an idea ‚Äì sketch out a project structure, a mind map, or just explain a concept. Every time, I had to open heavy editors like Miro or Figma, which felt like overkill.

So, I decided to build a tool that lives right inside the app I use for communication all day: Telegram.

I'm excited to share my side project: **Diagrammer Bot**. It's a simple yet powerful bot in Python that lets you create diagrams on the fly.

**Here are the key features:**
*   **Text & Image Nodes:** You can create blocks not just from text, but from any image you send.
*   **Full Editing:** Create, connect, edit, and delete both nodes and edges.
*   **Project System:** Save your diagrams with custom names, load them later, or start new ones.
*   **Themes & Export:** Switch between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode. Export your final diagram as a high-quality PNG.
*   **Open-Source:** The entire project is available on GitHub!

**Tech Stack:** Python, `python-telegram-bot`, `Graphviz` for rendering, and `Pillow` for watermarking.

I would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, feature ideas, or bug reports. And of course, a star ‚≠ê on GitHub would make my day!

 I'm a final year CS student and I've been reading about data storage and storage engines. This is a passion project that I've been working on for the past few months. It is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage engine in Python, built from scratch to understand and implement the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture. The project, which is fully open-source, is explicitly optimized for write-heavy workloads. 



# Core Architecture:

The engine implements the three fundamental LSM components: the **Write Ahead Log (WAL)** for durability, an in-memory **Memtable** (using `SortedDict` for sorted writes), and immutable persistent **SSTables (Sorted String Tables)**.

Some features that I'm proud of:

* **Async Compaction**: Merging and compaction are handled by a **separate background worker thread**. The process itself takes a hybrid approach.
* **Client/Server Model**: The entire storage engine runs behind a **FastAPI server**. This allows multiple clients to connect via REST APIs or the included CLI tool.
* **Efficient Range Queries**: Added full support for range queries from `start_key` to `end_key`. This is achieved via a memory-efficient **k-way merge iterator** that combines results from the Memtable and all SSTables. The FastAPI server delivers the results using a `StreamingResponse` to prevent memory exhaustion for large result sets.
* **Bloom Filter**: Implemented a **Bloom Filter** for each SSTable to drastically reduce disk I/O by confirming that a key definitely does not exist before attempting a disk seek.
* **Binary Storage**: SSTables now use **Msgpack binary format** instead of JSON for smaller file sizes and reduced CPU load during serialization/deserialization.

My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.

# Get Started

    pip install lsm_storage_engine_key_value_store

**Usage via CLI/Server:**

1. **Terminal 1 (Server):** `lsm-server`
2. **Terminal 2 (Client):** `lsm-cli` (Follow the CLI help for commands).

# Looking for Feedback

I'd love to hear your thoughts about this implementation and how I can make it better and what features I can add in later versions. Ideas and constructive criticism are always welcome. I'm also looking for contributors, if anyone is interested, please feel free to PM and we can discuss.

Hey everyone!

Like many of you, I often need to quickly visualize an idea ‚Äì sketch out a project structure, a mind map, or just explain a concept. Every time, I had to open heavy editors like Miro or Figma, which felt like overkill.

So, I decided to build a tool that lives right inside the app I use for communication all day: Telegram.

I'm excited to share my side project: **Diagrammer Bot**. It's a simple yet powerful bot in Python that lets you create diagrams on the fly.

**Here are the key features:**
*   **Text & Image Nodes:** You can create blocks not just from text, but from any image you send.
*   **Full Editing:** Create, connect, edit, and delete both nodes and edges.
*   **Project System:** Save your diagrams with custom names, load them later, or start new ones.
*   **Themes & Export:** Switch between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode. Export your final diagram as a high-quality PNG.
*   **Open-Source:** The entire project is available on GitHub!

**Tech Stack:** Python, `python-telegram-bot`, `Graphviz` for rendering, and `Pillow` for watermarking.

I would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, feature ideas, or bug reports. And of course, a star ‚≠ê on GitHub would make my day!

 I'm a final year CS student and I've been reading about data storage and storage engines. This is a passion project that I've been working on for the past few months. It is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage engine in Python, built from scratch to understand and implement the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture. The project, which is fully open-source, is explicitly optimized for write-heavy workloads. 



# Core Architecture:

The engine implements the three fundamental LSM components: the **Write Ahead Log (WAL)** for durability, an in-memory **Memtable** (using `SortedDict` for sorted writes), and immutable persistent **SSTables (Sorted String Tables)**.

Some features that I'm proud of:

* **Async Compaction**: Merging and compaction are handled by a **separate background worker thread**. The process itself takes a hybrid approach.
* **Client/Server Model**: The entire storage engine runs behind a **FastAPI server**. This allows multiple clients to connect via REST APIs or the included CLI tool.
* **Efficient Range Queries**: Added full support for range queries from `start_key` to `end_key`. This is achieved via a memory-efficient **k-way merge iterator** that combines results from the Memtable and all SSTables. The FastAPI server delivers the results using a `StreamingResponse` to prevent memory exhaustion for large result sets.
* **Bloom Filter**: Implemented a **Bloom Filter** for each SSTable to drastically reduce disk I/O by confirming that a key definitely does not exist before attempting a disk seek.
* **Binary Storage**: SSTables now use **Msgpack binary format** instead of JSON for smaller file sizes and reduced CPU load during serialization/deserialization.

My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.

# Get Started

    pip install lsm_storage_engine_key_value_store

**Usage via CLI/Server:**

1. **Terminal 1 (Server):** `lsm-server`
2. **Terminal 2 (Client):** `lsm-cli` (Follow the CLI help for commands).

# Looking for Feedback

I'd love to hear your thoughts about this implementation and how I can make it better and what features I can add in later versions. Ideas and constructive criticism are always welcome. I'm also looking for contributors, if anyone is interested, please feel free to PM and we can discuss.

What My Project Does:

* Produces low-level, inspectable output so you can see how program logic maps to in-game command-block logic.
* Implemented in Python for readability and easy contribution.

Target Audience:

* Minecraft command-block creators who want to run low-level programs without mods.
* Hobbyist compiler writers and learners looking for a compact Python codegen example.
* Contributors interested in parsing, code generation, testing strategies, or command optimization.
* This is an educational/hobby tool for small demos and experiments ‚Äî not a production compiler for large-scale programs.

Comparison (how it differs from alternatives):

* Assembly-focused: unlike high-level language‚ÜíMinecraft tools, it targets an assembly-like input so outputs are low-level and easy to debug in command blocks.
* Python-first and lightweight: prioritizes clarity and contributor-friendliness over performance.
* Command-block oriented: designed to work with vanilla in-game command blocks (does not target datapacks or mods).

How to help:

* Test: run examples, try outputs in a world, and note Minecraft version and exact steps when something fails.
* Report: open issues with minimal reproduction files and steps.

I‚Äôve always struggled to get data scientists and analysts to scale their code in the cloud. Almost every time, they‚Äôd have to hand it over to DevOps, the backlog would grow, and overall throughput would tank.

So I built **Burla**, the simplest cluster compute software that lets even Python beginners run code on massive clusters in the cloud. It‚Äôs one function with two parameters: the function and the inputs. You can bring your own Docker image, set hardware requirements, and run jobs as background tasks so you can fire and forget. Responses are fast, and you can call a million simple functions in just a few seconds.

Burla is built for embarrassingly parallel workloads like preprocessing data, hyperparameter tuning, and batch inference.

# Target Audience

Engineers, data scientists, and analysts who want to scale their code in production or research environments without dealing with infrastructure.

# Comparison

Unlike Ray or Dask, Burla doesn‚Äôt require cluster setup, orchestration, or YAML configs. It‚Äôs just:

    from burla import remote_parallel_map
    remote_parallel_map(func, inputs)
    

That‚Äôs it. It automatically handles distribution, retries, logging, and scaling across up to 10,000 VMs.

# Open Source & Free Credits

Burla is open source, and I‚Äôm improving the installation process. I also created managed versions for testing. If you want to try it, I‚Äôll cover 1,000 CPU hours and 100 GPU hours. Email me at [joe@burla.dev]() if interested.

* Contributors interested in parsing, code generation, testing strategies, or command optimization.
* This is an educational/hobby tool for small demos and experiments ‚Äî not a production compiler for large-scale programs.

Comparison (how it differs from alternatives):

* Assembly-focused: unlike high-level language‚ÜíMinecraft tools, it targets an assembly-like input so outputs are low-level and easy to debug in command blocks.
* Python-first and lightweight: prioritizes clarity and contributor-friendliness over performance.
* Command-block oriented: designed to work with vanilla in-game command blocks (does not target datapacks or mods).

How to help:

I‚Äôve always struggled to get data scientists and analysts to scale their code in the cloud. Almost every time, they‚Äôd have to hand it over to DevOps, the backlog would grow, and overall throughput would tank.

So I built **Burla**, the simplest cluster compute software that lets even Python beginners run code on massive clusters in the cloud. It‚Äôs one function with two parameters: the function and the inputs. You can bring your own Docker image, set hardware requirements, and run jobs as background tasks so you can fire and forget. Responses are fast, and you can call a million simple functions in just a few seconds.

Burla is built for embarrassingly parallel workloads like preprocessing data, hyperparameter tuning, and batch inference.

# Target Audience

Engineers, data scientists, and analysts who want to scale their code in production or research environments without dealing with infrastructure.

# Comparison

Unlike Ray or Dask, Burla doesn‚Äôt require cluster setup, orchestration, or YAML configs. It‚Äôs just:

    from burla import remote_parallel_map
    remote_parallel_map(func, inputs)
    

That‚Äôs it. It automatically handles distribution, retries, logging, and scaling across up to 10,000 VMs.

# Open Source & Free Credits

Burla is open source, and I‚Äôm improving the installation process. I also created managed versions for testing. If you want to try it, I‚Äôll cover 1,000 CPU hours and 100 GPU hours. Email me at [joe@burla.dev]() if interested.

Hey everyone!

Like many of you, I often need to quickly visualize an idea ‚Äì sketch out a project structure, a mind map, or just explain a concept. Every time, I had to open heavy editors like Miro or Figma, which felt like overkill.

So, I decided to build a tool that lives right inside the app I use for communication all day: Telegram.

I'm excited to share my side project: **Diagrammer Bot**. It's a simple yet powerful bot in Python that lets you create diagrams on the fly.

**Here are the key features:**
*   **Text & Image Nodes:** You can create blocks not just from text, but from any image you send.
*   **Full Editing:** Create, connect, edit, and delete both nodes and edges.
*   **Project System:** Save your diagrams with custom names, load them later, or start new ones.
*   **Themes & Export:** Switch between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode. Export your final diagram as a high-quality PNG.
*   **Open-Source:** The entire project is available on GitHub!

**Tech Stack:** Python, `python-telegram-bot`, `Graphviz` for rendering, and `Pillow` for watermarking.

I would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, feature ideas, or bug reports. And of course, a star ‚≠ê on GitHub would make my day!

 I'm a final year CS student and I've been reading about data storage and storage engines. This is a passion project that I've been working on for the past few months. It is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage engine in Python, built from scratch to understand and implement the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture. The project, which is fully open-source, is explicitly optimized for write-heavy workloads. 



# Core Architecture:

The engine implements the three fundamental LSM components: the **Write Ahead Log (WAL)** for durability, an in-memory **Memtable** (using `SortedDict` for sorted writes), and immutable persistent **SSTables (Sorted String Tables)**.

Some features that I'm proud of:

* **Async Compaction**: Merging and compaction are handled by a **separate background worker thread**. The process itself takes a hybrid approach.
* **Client/Server Model**: The entire storage engine runs behind a **FastAPI server**. This allows multiple clients to connect via REST APIs or the included CLI tool.
* **Efficient Range Queries**: Added full support for range queries from `start_key` to `end_key`. This is achieved via a memory-efficient **k-way merge iterator** that combines results from the Memtable and all SSTables. The FastAPI server delivers the results using a `StreamingResponse` to prevent memory exhaustion for large result sets.
* **Bloom Filter**: Implemented a **Bloom Filter** for each SSTable to drastically reduce disk I/O by confirming that a key definitely does not exist before attempting a disk seek.
* **Binary Storage**: SSTables now use **Msgpack binary format** instead of JSON for smaller file sizes and reduced CPU load during serialization/deserialization.

My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.

# Get Started

    pip install lsm_storage_engine_key_value_store

**Usage via CLI/Server:**

1. **Terminal 1 (Server):** `lsm-server`
2. **Terminal 2 (Client):** `lsm-cli` (Follow the CLI help for commands).

# Looking for Feedback

I'd love to hear your thoughts about this implementation and how I can make it better and what features I can add in later versions. Ideas and constructive criticism are always welcome. I'm also looking for contributors, if anyone is interested, please feel free to PM and we can discuss.

My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.

# Get Started

    pip install lsm_storage_engine_key_value_store

**Usage via CLI/Server:**

1. **Terminal 1 (Server):** `lsm-server`
2. **Terminal 2 (Client):** `lsm-cli` (Follow the CLI help for commands).

# Looking for Feedback

I'd love to hear your thoughts about this implementation and how I can make it better and what features I can add in later versions. Ideas and constructive criticism are always welcome. I'm also looking for contributors, if anyone is interested, please feel free to PM and we can discuss.
