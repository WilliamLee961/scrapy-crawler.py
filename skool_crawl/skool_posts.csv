Thanks in advance for anyone who took from their time and replied❤️  If i made a workflow how do i sell it to the client like do i export the JSON code and the client subscribes to the platform or should i self host it because i’m worried about the limited execution number  Also there are some people on TikTok talking about building AI infrastructure, what is it and how it differs from AI automations  And lastly regarding the new tools that allow users to build workflows by prompts, i understand that we sell results but doesn’t that make it easy for the clients to build there own workflows?  Thanks again for taking time to read the post 🫡❤️",False,2025-10-29 07:32:05.577890+00:00,"2 Abra Selim 40m • Support Needed 💻 Seeking advice from Experienced Automators Hello, lately i have been into AI automation and currently I'm taking Nate’s course but i had some questions in mind and i wanted to rely on experience not only AI to answer them.

9,Which One Do You Think is Better?,https://www.skool.com/ai-automation-society/which-one-do-you-think-is-better,Jim Growth,1h •,"We’re finalizing our offer structure for our AI Automation suite for businesses, and I’d love to get your thoughts 👇  We’re torn between two approaches:  Option 1: 👉 Offer 6 months FREE of our Conversational Chatbot (helps businesses qualify leads, reply to clients 24/7) 👉 Then give 15 days FREE of our AI Quotation/Proposal Maker (automates proposal sending + PDF generation)  Option 2: 👉 Offer 30 days FREE of the AI Quotation Maker first, 👉 Then upsell the Conversational Chatbot after they’ve experienced the quoting speed and ROI.  💡 Here’s the debate:  - Option 1  - Pros: Chatbots have instant wow-factor — everyone loves seeing replies automated in real-time. Great for awareness and brand trust.  - Con: Many businesses don’t yet realize the monetary ROI until they see the quoting or booking side working.  - Option 2  - Pros: The Quotation Maker gives visible results fast, time saved, proposals sent, leads converted. Easier to upsell the chatbot once they’ve seen real revenue impact. - Con: Slightly less “viral” than chatbots, less visual, more backend-driven.  Both strategies build trust, but one leads with conversation, the other with conversion.  So, what do you think is better for early traction?  Would you lead with free Chatbot or free Quotation Maker first?",False,2025-10-29 07:12:05.577898+00:00,"3 Jim Growth 1h • General Discussion 💬 Which One Do You Think is Better?
