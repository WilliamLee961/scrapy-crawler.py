The Hidden Reason Most AI Projects Fail (And It’s Not the Tech),https://www.skool.com/ai-automation-society/the-hidden-reason-most-ai-projects-fail-and-its-not-the-tech,c581aaee,Lê Lan Chi,18m •,1,3,"Here’s what most people miss:AI projects don’t fail because the model wasn’t good enough.They fail because no one redesigned the human workflow around it. Everyone rushes to “add AI” — automate a task, plug in a model, connect a few tools — but they forget the invisible layer:How humans interact with that new system. When you automate without redesigning the workflow, people stop trusting the process.They second-guess the AI.They create manual backups “just in case.”And ironically, the system becomes slower than before. Real AI transformation isn’t “replace humans with automation.”It’s rebuilding how humans, data, and decisions flow together — so that automation feels natural, not forced.",

All of a sudden, something clicked, and I realized the way I was designing workflows was incredibly inefficient. As if a wave of wisdom just washed through my brain, my workflows immediately went from (1)👇 to (2) 👇 - why go overkill with an agent when I can just message a model - why force feed the LLM every piece of information, when you can give it a tool to cherry-pick only the information it needs - And for godsake, why all the merging, aggregating and messy lines, when you can stringify json objects for the ai nodes...  I feel so clear-headed. I was introduced to 'make' about 2 months ago. Making simple automations for my own business. Now after consuming enormous amounts of youtube, podcasts, and long nights of experimenting with these platforms, I feel I am able to actually provide value to businesses. Efficiently & effectively.

This is how to sell your automations.,https://www.skool.com/ai-automation-society/how-to-actually-sell-your-automations,1d0abda5,Titus Blair,5d •,55,30,"@Ankush Dev recently asked the following and here are my answers, hope this helps!!  - How do I actually sell these automations? You need to know the problem you are solving and how big a problem it is, how much would people pay realistically to solve it. if they would pay as much as you charged for it you have a great solution, go for those!  - How should I structure and position my offers? If you solve a big enough problem you dont need to structure or position it at all it will sell itself. The HARDEST part is finding that problem!  - What’s the best way to deliver an AI agent or automation to a client once it’s ready? Create a N8N HOSTED account for them, maanged and run by N8N. Tell them the monthly charge + any markup or additional support/maintenance fees as a monthly subscription use the N8N levels of costs to calc overages or plan upgrades when needed.  - When it comes to ongoing usage, who usually covers the API costs — me or the client? You cover it all and bill them 1 subscription, It's important to set out usage caps and what happens if those caps are reached, new tier of subscription, overage charges etc. Make sure to WARN them well in advanced of hitting and caps/limits.  - Should I price based on one-time setup, monthly retainers, or usage-based billing? Monthly + Setup, most people understand this and you can work on the setup fee to sign a customer.  - How do you handle clients who don’t understand technical costs like APIs or hosting? They don't have to its a subscription that solves their biggest pain and allows them to grow and be stress free, its emotions!  - What’s the most beginner-friendly way to package and deliver these solutions (so the client doesn’t need to touch code)? You setup a N8N account for this client, you manage the workflows, etc they just pay the subscription + support + dev + maintenance etc fees.  Rem this is going to be done ENTIRELY by AI in the next 12-24 months so hustle!",

How I Made the n8n Workflow Simple with the 1 Code: Here's How,https://www.skool.com/ai-automation-society/how-i-made-the-n8n-workflow-simple-with-the-1-code-heres-how,a066638a,Hasnain Nisar,4h •,2,3,"A client reached out to me to automate a horse schedule sheet for 40+ horses. Every morning at 8 AM, they needed to track which services each horse would receive that day (e.g., Thursday services), update the sheet with the service details, and note the date.  The real kicker? At the end of the month, the client has to generate invoices, so they need to know exactly which horse received which service and how many times that month. This was becoming a huge manual task—checking the schedule, updating records, and creating invoices.  Initially, I used the Google Sheets part, with minor adjustments, and reused it repeatedly, which made the workflow more complex and harder for the client to understand.  So, I asked myself: 'How can I make this more efficient and simpler for the client, who might get stuck when making changes to such a complex workflow?  My Solution, I created custom code that takes information from the previous node, which changes every time (like the day names). Because the data changes, I used a switch condition. The same Google Sheets part, with minor adjustments, was being reused repeatedly, making the workflow more complex and larger. So, I wrote the code to fetch the name and pass the required information, allowing me to use the Google Sheets part just once. This simplifies the process, making it easier for the client to understand and make changes.  💬 Your Thoughts? If anyone has a different approach to solving this type of challenge or any tips for optimizing workflows with n8n and Google Sheets, feel free to share in the comments! Let’s collaborate and help each other out. 🙌  Also, let’s see if this project leads to another exciting opportunity to work on an invoicing workflow for the client.
