I think my team is working tremendously underpriced. I am working on a new business strategy that includes a multi-tier offer, with tempting extras and guarantees, and the distribution machine that will finally lead us to the payday we deserve.  I need to know what is a realistic baseline price for a “voice AI receptionist” built for a business for a one time higher fee plus operated for a monthly smaller retainer.  The base package includes a phone number (Twilio, Vonage), voice AI by VAPI, output to a data sink, knowledge base (with automated updates if necessary), calendar integration (if appointments are set by the robot).  Premium tiers, we want to drop in tempting extras for larger companies, so that a higher budget on the customer’s side will immediately result in an upsell. For example, monitoring and alerting features, based on the call log — like alerting calls that are semantically evaluated as of high importance. Or, custom integrations with databases or other systems, either on input data ot output side.  *EDIT* -- Friends, I need to clarify something. I'm not interested about API prices or any implementation detail. I'm interested in the price of a b2b solution delivered, end-to-end.

That was exactly what my client had in mind. He wanted a system that could automatically understand different message types, process them, and reply intelligently without needing constant human effort.  The problem was simple, too many customer messages coming in through WhatsApp, from text to audio to images. Sorting, understanding, and replying manually took too much time and slowed down his workflow. His goal was to automate conversations while keeping them natural and accurate.  I built the entire automation using n8n, integrating WhatsApp Cloud API, OpenAI models, and Google Sheets. The workflow starts with a WhatsApp trigger, checks if the message is text, audio, or image, then processes each accordingly, downloading, transcribing, or analyzing before merging everything into one flow. From there, an intent classifier routes the message to the right OpenAI model to generate the perfect response.  The biggest challenge was synchronizing multiple data types without breaking the logic. I solved it by implementing a flexible switch system, prompt memory, and precise intent routing.  The final result was seamless, a WhatsApp bot that runs 24/7, handling every message type with human-like understanding. The client was genuinely impressed; what once took hours now happens instantly.  This kind of automation is perfect for agencies, service businesses, coaches, and eCommerce brands that deal with high message volumes daily.  If you’ve ever wanted to simplify how you handle conversations or scale your communication without losing the human touch, let’s talk, I’d be happy to guide you on how to make it work for your business.",

That was exactly the situation my client found themselves in, managing multiple content assets, converting formats, uploading files, and syncing everything manually across platforms.  The goal was clear, automate the entire marketing asset creation and distribution process. The challenge? Each platform had its own requirements, file formats, and timing. Nothing was streamlined.  I approached the project with precision using n8n as the core automation platform. I integrated HTTP Requests, Google Drive, AI tools, and dynamic file processing nodes. The flow pulled in raw media, converted them into multiple formats, generated AI-based marketing assets, uploaded and synced them, all without human touch.  The biggest challenge was maintaining timing consistency between API responses and large media uploads. After several tests, I implemented strategic “Wait” nodes and file aggregations that stabilized the entire system perfectly.  Once completed, the client described it as “a full-time digital employee”, everything ran smoothly, assets delivered on time, and the workflow became 10x faster.  This kind of automation is a game changer for marketing agencies, content creators, and media teams who juggle files across tools daily.  If you’ve ever wished your processes could run themselves while you focus on growth, let’s talk. I’d love to help you build something that works while you sleep.",

That push led me to n8n, Nate’s YouTube videos, the free community — and then Plus. Last week I spoke with Yash about this decision and realized: I didn’t just buy a course; I invested in a circle that keeps me accountable, curious, and moving.  🔥 What actually moved the needle for me: - Community > Tools: tools evolve, but relationships compound. - Consistency compounding: late-night India-time grind turned into a personal brand. 🌙 - From “tech only” to “tech + business”: the One-Person AI Agency push flipped a switch for me. - Network as safety-net: confidence to take bolder client steps knowing AIS+ has my back. 💪 - Cross-everything learning: from 12-year-old builders to 60+ pros, every call stretches perspective.  🎯 Moments that mattered: - Lurking → helping on threads → real collaborations. - Weekly catch-ups with @Michael Wacht  sparked a small build. - A Notion MVP with Grace didn’t ship, but the lessons did. - Chill calls where one throwaway line saved me days. - Realizing I now ask better questions — half the game won.  💙 Gratitude (you know who you are): First off, @Nate Herk — for building this place and showing up daily with such genuine intent. None of this exists without you. @Apollo Martz and @Ednan Abdullayev — the tech lifelines, always steady and ready. @Yash Chauhan — the one who introduced me here and someone I now see as an integral pillar of AIS+. And @Jon Morrow — the man behind the curtain, who we don’t see much, but whose presence is felt in everything that runs smoothly.  Then there are the friendships that go beyond just posts and comments:  - @Michael Wacht — a friend for life, a teacher, and someone I deeply value. - @Nick Mohler and @Scott Rippey  — sharp minds I constantly learn from. - @Chirag Chhita  — who showed me the real power of supporting others. - @Holger Peschke r — that quiet, steady warmth you always appreciate. - @Maria Somana  — the bubbly energy you can’t help but smile with. - @Jason Hagen — always there alongside me in most interactions, helping others and making the journey lighter",
29,$60K Deal Closed!,https://www.skool.com/ai-automation-society/60k-deal-closed,0a7b165d,Mark Chiles,Aug 1 •,139,75,"I closed a $60K contract today at NeoSky AI for a client adding new voice agent products to work alongside their human agents. They didn’t want to add headcount, but also, didn’t want to lose valuable employees. So we’re upping the game with enhancing current team members, teaching them valuable AI skills, while incorporating an entire AI suite of products!

Stay the course everyone!",
